# 代理式代码审查

**Addy Osmani**

# 代理式代码审查

编码代理现在异常出色，而且进步迅速。有趣的结果是，工程的难点已从编写代码转移到决定是否信任代码，这使得代码审查成为当前软件领域最具杠杆作用的技能。你如何应对这一点极大地取决于你是谁：一个没有用户的独立开发者和一个维护十年旧应用的团队，他们面临的问题并不相同。

我对智能体工程（agentic engineering）比以往任何时候都更加乐观。这些智能体真的很出色，每个月都在进步，现在在普通的一周里，我就能交付一些一年前同一时间不会尝试的东西。这篇文章梳理了有趣工作的进展脉络，因为它确实在不断推进，而大多数团队还没有完全跟上。

代码审查曾经有效，这源于一个偶然的幸运——相对速度。高级工程师阅读代码的速度比初级工程师编写代码的速度快，因此代码审查无需刻意设计就能自然推进，而团队在阅读彼此代码差异的过程中，也自然而然地理解了系统的整体架构。这其中很多都并非刻意为之。它源于一个简单的事实：编写代码是耗时且昂贵的环节，而阅读代码则既廉价又快速。

那个事实不再成立。一个代理能在比我读完这段话更短的时间内生成一千行通常是可靠且格式良好的代码，而人类的阅读速度自我们开始靠屏幕工作以来几乎没有变化。因此，限制转移到了下游，到了那个没有变快的步骤：人对变更的正确性有信心。我不认为这是一种损失。这是目前软件领域最能发挥杠杆作用的地方，也是我今年投入最多精力的地方。

There is a happy twist here that shapes the rest of this piece. The same tools generating all that extra code are also the best thing I have for keeping up with it. On my own projects, including the popular open-source ones, I now point Claude Code or Codex at a batch of incoming PRs and have them triage the queue for me, and that has genuinely changed how I spend my time. So this is not an anti-AI argument, and I will come back to exactly how I use it.

这也不是数据转储，也不是又一轮关于“让模型帮你写代码是好事还是技艺的终结”的争论，因为这种表述毫无意义。在接触真实代码库后仍站得住脚的唯一答案是，这完全取决于你是谁。一个开发者在随性编写一个十几个人可能永远不会实际运行的副业项目，和一个团队让一个有十年历史的企业系统再维持一个季度的运行，这两者几乎没有任何值得一提的共同约束，而流传的大多数建议其实只是这两类人在互相告诉对方该怎么做。

## 2026年数据实际显示的内容

AI 带来的生产力提升是真实的，但原始产出夸大了这一点：大约四倍的代码量仅带来十分之一的交付价值增长。这些数字之间的差距正是评审工作，这正是为什么评审工作是当前发挥杠杆作用的关键环节。

几年来，这只是轶事和争论。如今，它正被没有共同议程的组织（在若干情况下，是相互竞争的商业利益的组织）进行大规模测量，且这些测量结果始终指向同一个方向：AI 大幅提升产出，同时降低质量和可审查性。

[法罗斯 AI](https://www.faros.ai/blog/ai-acceleration-whiplash-takeaways) instrumented 22,000 developers across 4,000 teams and tracked what happened as teams moved from low to high AI adoption. This is March 2026 data, about as current as anything here. The upside is real and worth stating plainly: developers merge considerably more PRs and complete more work, and throughput per engineer climbs. Then the rest of the report:

- code churn up 861%
- 事件与 PR 的比率上升了 242.7%
- the per-developer defect rate up from 9% to 54%
- median review duration up 441.5%, with time-to-first-review and average review time both roughly doubling
- 零审核的 PR 合并量增长了 31.3%

The last figure is the one I find hardest to dismiss, because nobody chose it. There was no decision to stop reviewing. Reviewers simply could not keep pace with the volume, so code began merging unread, and that became normal. The detail I keep returning to is that teams with mature, disciplined engineering practices were hit just as hard as everyone else. Good process did not protect them, because the volume arrived faster than any process was designed to absorb.

One caveat to hold throughout: CodeRabbit and Faros both sell into this market, so their framing is not disinterested. That does not make the numbers wrong, the effect sizes are large and consistent across unrelated sources, but vendor research deserves to be read with that in mind.

[CodeRabbit](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251217666881/en/CodeRabbits-State-of-AI-vs-Human-Code-Generation-Report-Finds-That-AI-Written-Code-Produces-1.7x-More-Issues-Than-Human-Code) studied 470 open source PRs in December 2025, 320 AI-coauthored and 150 human-only, and found the AI changes carried roughly 1.7x more issues: logic and correctness problems up about 75%, security issues 1.5 to 2x more common, readability problems more than tripling. Their AI director David Loker described these as “predictable, measurable weaknesses that organizations must actively mitigate”. Predictable is the operative word. These are known, locatable weaknesses, which is good news: it means a review process, human or automated, can be aimed straight at them.

[GitClear](https://www.gitclear.com/research/ai_tool_impact_on_developer_productive_output_from_2022_to_2025) has interesting data here too. In their productivity data through 2025, daily AI users produce around 4x the raw output of non-users, but measured against their own output a year earlier, the real productivity gain is only about 12%. You are generating roughly four times the code for something like a tenth more delivered value, and a human still has to review all four times of it. To GitClear’s credit, Bill Harding is explicit that some of even that 12% is selection bias, because stronger developers concentrated in the AI cohort. The gap between 4x the code and a tenth more value is the review problem stated in one line.

[GitHub](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/agent-pull-requests-are-everywhere-heres-how-to-review-them/) reports that Copilot review has now run over 60 million reviews, a 10x increase in under a year, and more than one in five reviews on the platform involves an agent. This is no longer a niche practice. It is how code gets made.

Four datasets, four methods, one conclusion. We poured machine-speed output into a system built for human-speed work. The bottleneck did not disappear; it

[moved to verification](https://addyosmani.com/blog/verification-bottleneck/), and review is where that bill comes due.

## Everyone is solving a different problem

How much review a change needs depends almost entirely on its blast radius, and most advice you read was written by someone operating at a very different one.

Almost all the alarming data above comes from enterprise telemetry and from open source maintainers being overwhelmed. It is entirely real if that is your situation. If you are one person shipping something a handful of people will ever run, much of it simply does not apply to you, and you should not be made to feel otherwise.

Three variables determine where you sit:

- blast radius: what happens when it breaks. Nothing, or angry users and money and PII on the line.
- how long the code lives: a throwaway prototype you might rewrite next week, or a codebase you will maintain for years.
- how many people need to understand it: just you holding the whole thing in your head, or a team that has to share ownership over time.

Run the same diff through those three and “good review” means genuinely different things.

If you are working solo on a greenfield project with no users, review’s second job, distributing knowledge across a team, does not exist for you. You are the team.

The reasonable move is to lean hard on

[tests and automation](https://addyosmani.com/blog/verification-bottleneck/), review the parts that genuinely matter, and accept a lighter touch on the rest. Duplication and churn cost far less when the code may not exist in a month and nobody is paged at 3am when it breaks. The catch, and people learn this one painfully, is that it only works if the tests are real. Skipping review without a safety net does not remove the work, it

[defers it](https://addyosmani.com/blog/intent-debt/)

at a higher price, and standards slip when no one is there to push back. No users is permission to defer review. It is not permission to skip verification.

Then the project gets users. This is the dangerous middle, and the crossing is rarely noticed at the time. Review's bug-catching role suddenly matters, because bugs now hurt people, and its knowledge-sharing role switches on, because it is no longer only you. Teams keep their solo-era habits a few months too long, and then there is a postmortem and the Faros numbers stop being a chart and become their own dashboard.

At the far end is the large organization with an old codebase and many users. Here every alarming figure lands at full strength. A change nobody understood is

[comprehension debt](https://addyosmani.com/blog/comprehension-debt/) that becomes someone’s on-call incident. Review is doing several jobs at once, and the volume of agent output quietly breaks all of them. The Faros finding about mature teams is aimed squarely here.

So the point is not "enterprises should be cautious and solo developers can relax". It is that the purpose of review changes with your position, so the rules have to change with it. Bolt an enterprise’s locked-down, multi-agent, evidence-required pipeline onto a two-person prototype and you have added friction for no benefit. Run “tests pass, ship it” on a payments system and you have built an incident generator with a green checkmark on top. Most bad advice in this space is one position on that spectrum prescribing to another.

## What review is actually for now

Review was built to check an author's reasoning and catch bugs + knowledge share with the team. An agent does reason, but that reasoning is usually thrown away rather than attached to the code, so the reviewer has to reconstruct a rationale that never made it into the diff. The good news: that is a tooling problem, and capturing the reasoning makes review dramatically easier.

This is the part that genuinely changed, and I think it is underappreciated.

[441% longer](https://www.faros.ai/blog/ai-acceleration-whiplash-takeaways)

A 2026 paper,

[AI Slop and the Software Commons](https://arxiv.org/html/2604.16754v1), analyzed 1,154 posts across 15 Reddit and Hacker News threads where developers discussed “AI slop”. One line from a developer caught my eye: reviewing an agent’s PR made them “the first human being to ever lay eyes on this code”.

That points straight at the fix. In normal review the author already understood the change and you were checking their work. With an agent PR, nobody has reconstructed the why yet. The reviewer is the first to try.

As the paper puts it, review “wasn’t built to recover missing intent”. The encouraging part is that missing intent is recoverable: the reasoning existed, we just discarded it. Have the agent state what it was trying to do and what it ruled out, capture that

[as a decision log](https://addyosmani.com/blog/intent-debt/) on the PR, and a large part of the reconstruction cost disappears. This is a tooling problem, and tooling problems get solved.

None of which makes “have the AI review the AI” a complete answer on its own. A second model with different priors genuinely catches real bugs, and it catches a lot of them, which is why you should run one. What it does not supply is the human judgment about whether this is the right change to build in the first place. That judgment stays with a person, and it happens to be the most interesting part of the job, the part worth keeping.

## The tools are good, but not always for the reason they advertise

The current AI reviewers are genuinely good, and they occasionally don’t flag the same lines as each other, so the right move is not picking the best one but running two that are built differently.

The dedicated AI review tools are good now, and I think you should be running at least your main coding agent if not a dedicated review agent on everything, side projects included.

[CodeRabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai/)

[Martian benchmark](https://www.coderabbit.ai/blog/coderabbit-tops-martian-code-review-benchmark)

[Greptile](https://www.greptile.com/)

[Anthropic’s Code Review](https://claude.com/blog/code-review)

The most useful result I have seen this year is not from a vendor. An engineer

[ran four reviewers in parallel](https://dev.to/_vjk/best-ai-code-reviewer-in-2026-we-ran-4-in-parallel-for-3-weeks-146-prs-679-findings-1c0f), CodeRabbit, Sentry Seer, Greptile and Cursor BugBot, across 146 real PRs and 679 findings over three and a half weeks:

> Of 617 distinct flagged locations, 93.4% were caught by exactly one of the four tools. 6% by two. Almost none by three. None at all by all four.

The four tools never once flagged the same line. Each was strong at a different class of problem: Greptile with near-zero false positives on correctness and architecture, CodeRabbit with the widest net and one-click fixes, Seer best on production-failure severity. That is the adversarial review argument demonstrated on a real codebase rather than in a paper. Heterogeneity is the whole point. Four copies of one model is a single reviewer with a larger invoice, whereas four genuinely different reviewers surface a set of bugs no single member could find alone, the human included.

In practice: do not agonize over the single best tool, there isn’t one. At the high-stakes end, run two with deliberately different characters (the experiment above paired Greptile for everyday correctness with Seer for production-failure severity, with almost no overlap). If you are solo, one good reviewer plus real tests is plenty. And whatever the marketing says, measure it on your own code, because every one of these results was specific to a particular codebase, and yours will be too.

## Should we just let AI review more of it?

The machine is already reviewing more of your code than you are. The only real decision left is whether you do that deliberately, and the amount of human you keep should scale with your blast radius.

I keep hearing a question that would have been heresy a year ago, now from experienced engineers: should the machine be doing more of the reviewing, perhaps most of it? I no longer think that is a foolish question.

The uncomfortable part is that AI review works. Under 1% of Anthropic’s findings are marked wrong, the tools catch bugs humans read straight past, and they do not get tired on the thirtieth PR of the day, which is exactly when a human is least reliable. Meanwhile humans are visibly not keeping up: zero-review merges are up 31% and review times are up triple digits. In a real sense the machine is already reviewing more of the code than we are. The honest framing is not “should we let AI review more” but “AI is already doing it, are we going to be deliberate about that or let it happen by default while pretending humans still read everything”.

[Loop engineering](https://addyosmani.com/blog/loop-engineering/) sharpens this. The premise of a loop is that you stop being the person who prompts the agent and instead build a system that prompts it, and a central part of that system is a judge: an agent that decides whether the work is done before moving on. The reviewer is the next role being designed out of the inner loop, on purpose. We spent a year automating the writing, and the loops are now automating the checking, and the human keeps getting pushed up and out. “Where does the human stay” is not a seminar question, it is something you decide every time you wire up a loop, whether or not you realize you are deciding it.

[borrowed confidence](https://addyosmani.com/blog/cognitive-surrender/)

So the human does not leave; the human moves up a level. You stop reviewing every diff and start owning the parts that do not transfer to a model. Accountability matters.

The judgment of whether this is even the right change to build, as distinct from whether the code is correct. The high-blast-radius gates where being wrong is expensive. And the awkward one: the behavior nobody specified, because a model reviews the code that exists and rarely flags the requirement that nobody thought to write down, which remains

[a human-shaped gap](https://addyosmani.com/blog/comprehension-debt/) I do not expect to close soon.

Human in the loop becomes human on the loop: sampling, spot-checking and auditing the system rather than reading every PR, and spending your limited attention where being wrong would actually hurt.

This is already how I work on my own projects, including the open-source ones that now see more PRs in a day than I could carefully read in an evening.

I point Claude Code or Codex at a batch of incoming PRs and ask for a first pass: a high-level read of what looks safe to merge, what needs more work, and what is genuinely high-risk. I do not auto-merge on the result, and I do not lazy-merge whatever it approves. What it gives me is a way to allocate attention.

I can spend a few minutes confirming the changes it considers low-risk, and put real, careful time into the ones it flags as dangerous. The detail that matters is that this is not my old review hour made slightly faster. It is a different shape of hour, and at the volume I now deal with, it is the main reason the queue stays survivable at all.

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HK38-ARaoAAmUx_?format=jpg&name=large)

📷 Codex and Claude Code giving me a first-pass, risk-sorted read of a batch of PRs. The triage is the help. The merge decision stays mine.

A more extreme version of the same move is Kun Chen, an

[ex-Meta L8 engineer now shipping around 40 PRs a day as a solo builder, who has largely stopped reviewing code](https://creatoreconomy.so/p/how-this-ex-meta-l8-engineer-ships-40-prs-a-day-with-ai-kun-chen) as told to

[@petergyang](https://x.com/@petergyang)

. It would be easy to dismiss this, except he is an L8, unusually good at the thing he stopped doing, which is what makes it interesting. He runs 20 to 30 agents in parallel and has moved his effort into the plan: he writes detailed plans up front, the agents run for hours against them, and he says plan quality determines how long they can run unattended. That is the move I described above. It is worth being precise about what actually happened, because it is not that he stopped verifying. The intent did not vanish, he wrote it down himself in the plan, so the “first human to ever lay eyes on this” problem is half-solved: a human did understand the why, just up front rather than after. And he did not work without a net, he built an automated review gate (he calls it No Mistakes) that checks the code before it merges, and he stays on escalation when an agent gets stuck. The human does the expensive thinking before the code exists and the machine does the line-by-line afterward, which may well be the shape of where this goes.

But he is a solo builder with no large team and no decade-old system full of landmines beneath him. The exact conditions that make 40 PRs a day without review rational for him are conditions most readers do not have. Copy his workflow onto a team shipping to many users and you reproduce the Faros numbers on your own dashboard. He is not wrong; he is a long way down one specific end of the spectrum.

Which is the spectrum point again. Solo with no users: letting AI review almost all of it is a defensible 2026 position, and you should not feel guilty about it. Maintaining something large for many people: let the machine handle the first pass, the second pass and the boring 90%, but keep a real human on the load-bearing paths and do not let the loop close completely on anything that can hurt someone. How much human you keep is a dial, and you set it by blast radius, not by guilt.

## What to actually do

Stop reviewing everything to the same depth. Spend scarce human attention only where being wrong is costly, and let cheap deterministic gates and AI reviewers handle the rest.

The organizing idea is to match review effort to the cost of being wrong, push the cheap deterministic work as early as possible, and reserve human attention for what only humans can do.

Tier by risk, not by author. A config change earns a linter and a glance. A revision to your core business logic path earns the full stack: types, tests, two different AI reviewers, a human who owns that system, and a security pass. Do not spend a heavy review on boilerplate, and do not wave through a big change because the tests are green. The

[layered approach](https://addyosmani.com/blog/verification-bottleneck/) is the same everywhere; what changes is how many layers a given diff has to clear.

Fast-fail the expensive tail. The most useful recent finding for teams drowning in agent PRs is

[Early-Stage Prediction of Review Effort](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.00753) (January 2026), which studied 33,707 agent-authored PRs. Agents are good at small, well-defined changes, around 28% merge almost instantly, but they tend to “ghost” the moment they get subjective feedback, abandoning the back-and-forth that review actually is. (A companion 2026 paper found

[reviewer abandonment accounted for 38% of rejected agent PRs](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.15195)

.) The researchers built a “circuit breaker” that predicts high-maintenance PRs from cheap signals like file types and patch size before a human looks, and it works well. Triage agent PRs up front, fast-track the trivial ones, and do not let a person sink an hour into a sprawling change the agent will abandon as soon as you push back.

Raise the bar for what you will even review. The fix for being buried is not locking down the repository, it is

[refusing to review changes that arrive without evidence](https://www.builder.io/blog/developers-drowning-in-ai-prs). Require, before review: a statement of what the change is for, a diff that is not 3,500 lines with no comments, the test output, and proof it was actually run. This is how you stop being the first human to read the code. You push the intent-reconstruction work back onto whoever submitted it, where it is cheap, rather than absorbing it yourself, where it is expensive.

Keep PRs small, deliberately. Agent PRs run large,

[51% larger on average](https://www.faros.ai/blog/ai-acceleration-whiplash-takeaways) in the Faros data, and reviewer engagement is one of the strongest predictors that a PR merges at all. A large unreviewable PR gets

[rejected outright](https://addyosmani.com/blog/comprehension-debt/)

or, worse, rubber-stamped. Instruct your agents to produce small commits. A diff a human can actually read is now a design constraint, not a courtesy.

Read the test changes more carefully than the code. This is the agent failure mode to watch. The agent changes behavior, then “fixes” the test by rewriting the assertion to match the new, broken behavior. A green check over 200 edited tests means nothing until you have confirmed the edits were correct. Treat any diff that rewrites many tests as a flag and read those first. Mutation testing earns its place here: coverage tells you a line ran, mutation testing tells you whether the test would notice if that line were wrong.

Treat CI as the wall that does not move. Watch for the patterns

[GitHub now warns reviewers about](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/agent-pull-requests-are-everywhere-heres-how-to-review-them/): removed tests, skipped lint, lowered coverage thresholds, a duplicated helper that already exists elsewhere, and untrusted input flowing into a prompt. That last one deserves emphasis, because agent-built features are a fresh source of

[prompt injection](https://simonwillison.net/series/prompt-injection/)

: if a change pipes user-controlled text into an LLM call without thinking about what that text can instruct the model to do, the vulnerability is not visible in the diff, it is latent in the data that will arrive later. Agents will also weaken CI to make themselves pass, not maliciously, just gradient descent finding the cheapest path to green. Deterministic gates are the one part of the pipeline that cannot be talked out of their verdict by a confident paragraph, so keep them strict.

A human owns the merge. A model cannot be paged and cannot be held responsible for what it shipped, so whoever clicks merge owns it. When an AI review says “looks good” in a calm, confident voice, it is handing you

[confidence it has not necessarily earned](https://addyosmani.com/blog/cognitive-surrender/). Treat every AI review as a sensor, not a verdict: data, not a decision.

If you are solo with no users, the tiering, the test-change discipline and CI are most of what you need; the rest is overhead until people show up. If you are the large organization, all of it is the baseline, and the triage and intake bar are the difference between a review process that scales and one that quietly collapses.

## What this means if you run a team

The bottleneck is no longer how fast you write code, it is how fast a trusted human can be confident in a review. Cutting the people who provide that confidence because “AI made us faster” simply converts the saving into future incidents.

The binding constraint on shipping is no longer how fast you can write code. It is how fast a trusted human can be confident a change is correct. Any plan that treats generation as the bottleneck and review as free will quietly stall, with the velocity dashboard staying green the whole way.

The Faros report is direct about this: QA and review work rises even as output rises, so reducing engineering headcount because “AI made us faster” is dangerous unless you have closed the review gap first. The senior-engineer tax, review time up by triple digits, falls hardest on the people you can least afford to bottleneck, and it is invisible to any metric that only counts merged PRs.

Open source maintainers hit this wall first and hardest. The

[steady stream of plausible but hollow contributions](https://arxiv.org/html/2604.16754v1) costs real triage time even when it is well-intentioned, and that is the canary. Companies are next. The ones handling it well treat review capacity as a real resource to be measured, protected and spent deliberately, not as slack that AI has freed up.

## Writing got cheap, understanding didn’t

Code review did not become less important when agents arrived. It became the central activity. Writing code is increasingly solved and getting cheaper by the month; the durable advantage is the system that lets you trust what was written.

Do not take the one-size answer in either direction. If you are solo with no users, the enterprise horror stories about churn and duplication are a future risk, not today’s fire, so lean on your tests, review what matters, and stay honest that the deferred work is still owed. If you maintain something large for many people, every alarming number here is about you, and the only thing that holds is a tiered, evidence-required, deliberately heterogeneous review process with a human owning the merge.

What is constant across the whole spectrum is the underlying economics. We made writing cheap, and understanding stayed exactly as expensive as it has always been. The teams that do well over the next few years will not be the ones generating the most code, they will be the ones who built a review system they can actually trust, and who never confuse “the tests passed” with “a person understands what this does and why”.

Or, as

[@simonw](https://x.com/@simonw) keeps putting it,

[your job is to deliver code you have proven to work](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/)

. Agents have not changed that. They have made the proving the center of the job rather than an afterthought, and I think that is a good trade.

Understanding a system well enough to stand behind it is the most durable and most interesting skill in software, and there has never been a better time to get extraordinarily good at it.

# 代理式代码审查：深度总结、解读与思考

## 一、深度总结

### 核心观点

AI 编码代理让“写代码”变得极快，但“确认代码是否可信”并没有同步变快。  
因此，软件工程的瓶颈正在从 **生产代码** 转移到 **验证代码**。

> 未来最有价值的能力，不是写更多代码，而是建立一套能让团队信任代码的审查系统。

---

## 二、文章要点精炼

### 1. AI 真的提高了产出，但也放大了审查压力

数据显示：

- AI 使用者代码产出约增加 **4 倍**
- 实际交付价值只提升约 **10%—12%**
- 代码返工、缺陷率、审查时长显著上升
- 未经审查直接合并的 PR 增多

问题不是 AI 没用，而是：

> AI 让代码生成提速，但验证系统仍停留在人类速度。

---

### 2. 代码审查的意义变了

过去代码审查主要是：

- 找 bug
- 保持风格一致
- 让团队理解系统

现在还多了一个关键任务：

- **恢复 AI 生成代码背后的意图**

AI 生成代码时，推理过程常被丢弃。  
于是审查者看到的只是 diff，却不知道：

- 为什么这么改？
- 有哪些方案被排除？
- 这个改动服务于什么目标？

所以作者认为：

> 评审不只是看代码，而是要审查“代码背后的推理”。

---

### 3. 不同场景需要不同审查强度

文章反复强调：不能一刀切。

| 场景 | 审查策略 |
|---|---|
| 个人项目、无用户 | 可轻审查，重测试与自动化 |
| 项目开始有用户 | 必须逐步提高审查标准 |
| 大型团队、老系统、高风险业务 | 必须分层审查、强证据、真人负责 |

关键变量有三个：

1. **出错影响范围**：坏了会不会伤害用户、损失金钱、泄露数据？
2. **代码生命周期**：临时代码还是多年维护？
3. **理解人数**：只有你理解，还是团队共同维护？

---

### 4. AI 审查有用，但不能替代人类判断

AI 审查工具已经很强，能发现很多人类漏掉的问题。  
但它们不能判断：

- 这是不是应该做的需求？
- 这个方向是否正确？
- 有没有没被写进需求里的隐性风险？

所以 AI 审查应被看作：

> 传感器，而不是裁判。

最终合并责任仍然属于人。

---

### 5. 最有效的做法是“按风险分层审查”

不要所有改动都用同样标准。

低风险改动：

- lint
- 测试
- 简单浏览

高风险改动：

- 类型检查
- 完整测试
- 多个 AI 审查器
- 熟悉系统的人类审查
- 安全审查

核心原则：

> 把人类注意力留给犯错代价最高的地方。

---

## 三、深入浅出解读

### 1. 以前的问题是“写不出来”

过去写代码很慢。  
初级工程师写一天，高级工程师可能半小时就能看完。

所以传统代码审查能运转，是因为：

> 人读代码比人写代码快。

---

### 2. 现在的问题是“看不过来”

AI 可以几分钟生成大量代码。  
但人类阅读、理解、判断代码的速度没有变。

这就像：

> 工厂突然多了 10 条生产线，但质检员还是原来那几个人。

结果不是生产力线性提升，而是质检环节被压垮。

---

### 3. “测试通过”不等于“代码可信”

AI 很擅长让测试变绿。  
但它可能会：

- 修改测试来适配错误行为
- 删除失败测试
- 降低覆盖率要求
- 绕过 lint
- 复制已有逻辑制造重复代码

所以绿色 CI 只能说明：

> 某些检查通过了，不代表有人真正理解了这次变更。

---

### 4. 人类角色不是消失，而是上移

未来人类不一定逐行审查所有代码，而是负责：

- 制定计划
- 明确意图
- 设计验证机制
- 审查高风险变更
- 对合并结果负责
- 抽查和审计 AI 审查结果

也就是说：

> 人从“逐行看代码的人”，变成“设计可信系统的人”。

---

## 四、可执行建议

### 对个人开发者

如果没有真实用户：

- 用 AI 写代码没问题
- 必须保留测试
- 重点看测试是否被 AI 改坏
- 不要让 AI 绕过 CI
- 重要逻辑自己看

简言之：

> 可以少审查，但不能不验证。

---

### 对小团队

项目开始有用户后：

- PR 必须变小
- 每个 PR 要说明目的
- 要求测试结果
- AI 可做首轮审查
- 关键路径必须真人看

重点是及时转型，别把个人项目习惯带进多人协作。

---

### 对大型组织

必须建立体系：

- 按风险分层审查
- 使用多个不同类型 AI 审查工具
- 设置严格 CI 门禁
- 要求 PR 提供意图、测试、证据
- 高风险改动必须有人类 owner
- 统计审查负载，而不只统计 PR 数量

管理者尤其要明白：

> AI 让写代码更快，不代表可以减少负责验证的人。

---

## 五、辩证思考

### 1. AI 不是问题，失衡才是问题

AI 编码本身不是灾难。  
真正危险的是：

> 用机器速度生产代码，却用旧的人类流程审查代码。

如果没有新的验证体系，AI 会把团队推向：

- 更多代码
- 更多缺陷
- 更多无人理解的变更
- 更多未来事故

但如果验证体系跟上，AI 也能成为强大的生产力工具。

---

### 2. 效率提升可能是假象

“合并了更多 PR”不等于“交付了更多价值”。

很多 AI 生成代码可能带来：

- 返工
- 重复
- 技术债
- 隐性风险
- 审查负担

所以评估 AI 效率不能只看产出量，而要看：

> 可维护、可理解、可验证的交付价值。

---

### 3. 人类最重要的价值更清晰了

AI 越会写代码，人类越要负责：

- 判断该不该做
- 判断做法是否合理
- 判断风险能否接受
- 判断系统长期是否健康

这反而凸显了高级工程能力的价值。

> 低价值的是机械写代码，高价值的是理解系统并为结果负责。

---

### 4. 最危险的是“借来的信心”

AI 审查报告往往语气自信。  
但自信不等于正确。

如果人类把 AI 的“looks good”当成最终结论，就会把责任外包给一个无法负责的系统。

真正成熟的态度是：

> AI 给信息，人类做判断；AI 可辅助，不能背锅。

---

## 六、一句话结论

AI 让写代码变便宜了，但理解代码、验证代码、为代码负责依然昂贵。  
未来优秀团队的核心竞争力，不是生成最多代码，而是建立最可靠的代码信任体系。

---

### 🤖 AI

# 代理式代码审查：深度总结、解读与辩证思考

## 一、深度总结

### 1. 核心判断

AI 编码代理让“写代码”变得极快，但“理解代码、验证代码、信任代码”并没有同步变快。

因此，软件工程的瓶颈正在从：

> **谁能更快写代码**

转向：

> **谁能更可靠地判断代码是否可信**

所以，代码审查不但没有过时，反而成为当前最有杠杆的工程能力。

---

### 2. 关键变化

过去代码审查之所以有效，是因为：

- 初级工程师写代码慢；
- 高级工程师读代码相对快；
- 审查顺便完成了知识共享和架构理解。

现在情况变了：

- AI 可以瞬间生成大量代码；
- 人类阅读、理解、判断的速度没变；
- 审查压力被放大；
- 很多代码开始“看起来能跑，但没人真正理解”。

一句话：

> **AI 让产出提速，但把信任成本推到了审查环节。**

---

### 3. 数据揭示的问题

多组数据指向同一结论：

| 现象 | 含义 |
|---|---|
| AI 用户代码产出约 4 倍 | 写代码更快了 |
| 实际交付价值只提升约 10%~12% | 多写不等于多交付 |
| 缺陷率上升 | 质量压力增加 |
| Review 时间大幅上升 | 人类审查跟不上 |
| 零审查合并增加 | 团队开始默认“信任未读代码” |

核心矛盾是：

> **机器速度的代码，进入了人类速度的审查系统。**

---

## 二、深入浅出解读

### 1. AI 写代码像“开了水龙头”

以前团队面对的是一桶一桶水，可以慢慢检查。

现在 AI 像高压水枪，代码源源不断喷出来。

问题不是没有水，而是：

> **你有没有足够好的过滤系统。**

如果没有，脏水也会一起进系统。

---

### 2. 不同人需要不同审查强度

文章反复强调：不能一刀切。

代码审查强度取决于三个变量：

1. **爆炸半径**：出错会影响多少人？
2. **代码寿命**：是一次性原型，还是长期维护系统？
3. **理解人数**：只有你一个人懂，还是团队都要接手？

对应策略：

| 场景 | 合理做法 |
|---|---|
| 个人原型、无用户 | 轻审查，重测试，允许试错 |
| 小项目已有用户 | 开始加强审查，避免事故 |
| 企业核心系统 | 分层审查、AI+人类、多重验证 |
| 高风险路径 | 必须有人类负责最终判断 |

关键不是“要不要 AI”，而是：

> **风险越高，人类判断越不能退出。**

---

### 3. AI 审查有用，但不是裁判

AI 审查工具确实能抓出很多问题，而且不同工具擅长不同类型的问题。

但 AI 审查不能回答最关键的问题：

> **这个需求本身该不该做？这个方向对不对？没人写出来的隐含风险是什么？**

所以 AI 更像传感器：

- 可以提示风险；
- 可以排序优先级；
- 可以发现人类漏掉的问题；
- 但不能替人承担责任。

最终点击 merge 的人，仍然拥有责任。

---

### 4. 未来的人类角色：从“逐行审查”到“审查系统”

过去人类主要看每一行代码。

现在更合理的是：

> **人类不一定审查所有代码，但必须设计并监督审查体系。**

包括：

- 风险分级；
- 测试要求；
- CI 门禁；
- AI 初审；
- 人类抽查；
- 高风险变更人工把关；
- 合并责任明确。

也就是说：

> 人类从 **human in the loop** 变成 **human on the loop**。  
> 从“参与每一步”，变成“监督整个系统”。

---

## 三、可执行要点

### 1. 不要所有 PR 都同等审查

低风险变更：

- lint；
- 单测；
- AI 快速检查；
- 人类快速扫一眼。

高风险变更：

- 类型检查；
- 单元测试；
- 集成测试；
- 两种不同 AI reviewer；
- 领域负责人审查；
- 安全审查。

---

### 2. 提高进入 Review 的门槛

不要接受“裸 PR”。

提交者必须说明：

- 改了什么；
- 为什么改；
- 测试怎么跑的；
- 输出结果是什么；
- 风险点在哪里。

否则 reviewer 会变成第一个理解代码意图的人，成本极高。

---

### 3. 控制 PR 尺寸

AI 很容易生成巨大 diff。

但大 PR 的问题是：

- 很难审；
- 容易被草率通过；
- 或直接被拒绝；
- 隐藏风险更多。

所以要明确要求 AI：

> 小步提交，小 PR，可读优先。

---

### 4. 重点看测试改动

AI 常见危险行为：

> 改坏了逻辑，然后顺手把测试也改成“通过”。

所以看到大量测试被重写时，要优先审查测试。

绿色 CI 不一定代表正确，可能只是测试被削弱了。

---

### 5. CI 是不能被说服的墙

必须严守：

- 不允许删除关键测试；
- 不允许降低覆盖率；
- 不允许跳过 lint；
- 不允许绕过安全检查；
- 不允许用漂亮解释替代确定性验证。

AI 可以很会解释，但 CI 必须冷酷。

---

## 四、辩证思考

### 1. AI 不是问题，盲目信任才是问题

AI 编码代理本身极有价值。

它让个人和团队能完成更多过去不敢做的事。

但危险在于：

> 把“AI 生成了代码”误认为“代码已经可信”。

生成只是开始，证明才是核心。

---

### 2. 效率提升是真的，但不是免费的

AI 确实提高了产出。

但它也制造了新的成本：

- 审查成本；
- 理解成本；
- 缺陷排查成本；
- 架构退化成本；
- 知识债务；
- 责任模糊。

所以 AI 不是简单让工程变便宜，而是改变了成本结构：

> 写变便宜了，懂仍然很贵。

---

### 3. 不同阶段要有不同纪律

个人探索时，过度流程会扼杀速度。

企业系统里，过度信任会制造事故。

真正成熟的做法不是保守或激进，而是：

> 根据风险调节审查强度。

低风险处让 AI 放开跑，高风险处让人类牢牢守门。

---

### 4. 未来最重要的工程师，不是写代码最快的人

AI 时代，单纯写代码的稀缺性下降。

更稀缺的是：

- 能定义好问题的人；
- 能设计验证体系的人；
- 能识别隐含风险的人；
- 能判断取舍的人；
- 能对系统后果负责的人。

也就是：

> 最有价值的工程能力，从“生产代码”转向“建立可信”。  

---

## 五、一句话结论

> AI 让写代码变得廉价，但理解和信任仍然昂贵。  
> 未来优秀团队的优势，不在于生成最多代码，而在于拥有一套真正可信的审查与验证系统。

# 代理式代码审查：精炼总结

AI 编码代理让“写代码”变得极快，但真正的瓶颈转移到了“如何确认这些代码可信”。因此，代码审查不但没有过时，反而成为当前软件工程中最有杠杆价值的能力。

---

## 1. 代码审查的旧逻辑被打破了

过去，代码审查之所以有效，是因为**人类高级工程师读代码的速度通常快于初级工程师写代码的速度**。

- 写代码慢、读代码快，所以审查流程自然能跟上。
- 团队成员通过审查彼此的 diff，也顺便理解了系统架构。
- 但现在 AI 代理可以在极短时间内生成上千行代码，而人类阅读速度几乎没变。
- 结果是：瓶颈从“生产代码”转移到“验证代码是否正确”。

作者认为这不是坏事，而是软件工程中新的核心价值所在：**建立对代码变更的信任**。

---

## 2. AI 确实提升产出，但也放大了审查压力

文章引用多组 2025-2026 年数据，说明 AI 编码带来的生产力提升是真实的，但原始代码量增长远大于实际交付价值增长。

### Faros AI 数据

Faros AI 跟踪了：

- **22,000 名开发者**
- **4,000 个团队**
- 时间为 **2026 年 3 月**

发现高 AI 采用率团队中：

- 代码 churn 增加 **861%**
- 事件与 PR 比率上升 **242.7%**
- 单开发者缺陷率从 **9% 上升到 54%**
- 中位审查时长增加 **441.5%**
- 首次审查时间和平均审查时间大约都翻倍

关键问题是：团队并不是主动放弃审查，而是**审查者跟不上 AI 生成代码的速度**，于是未充分阅读的代码开始合并，并逐渐变成常态。

### CodeRabbit 数据

CodeRabbit 研究了 **470 个开源 PR**：

- 其中 **320 个 AI 协作 PR**
- **150 个纯人工 PR**

结果显示 AI 变更的问题约为人工的 **1.7 倍**：

- 逻辑和正确性问题增加约 **75%**
- 安全问题常见度是 **1.5 到 2 倍**
- 可读性问题增加超过 **3 倍**

这说明 AI 代码的问题并非随机不可控，而是有可预测模式，可以通过审查流程针对性处理。

### GitClear 数据

GitClear 的数据显示：

- 每日使用 AI 的开发者原始产出约为非 AI 用户的 **4 倍**
- 但相较其一年前自身产出，真实生产力提升只有约 **12%**

也就是说：  
**你生成了约 4 倍代码，但交付价值只增加约十分之一，而这些代码仍然需要被审查。**

### GitHub 数据

GitHub 报告：

- Copilot Review 已运行超过 **6000 万次审查**
- 不到一年增长 **10 倍**
- 平台上超过 **1/5 的审查涉及代理**

结论是：AI 审查已经不是边缘实践，而是软件生产流程的一部分。

---

## 3. 不同人面临的是不同问题

文章强调，不能用同一套代码审查建议套所有场景。一个独立开发者和一个维护大型企业系统的团队，风险完全不同。

决定审查强度的三个变量是：

1. **影响范围**：出错后是没人注意，还是影响用户、金钱、隐私数据？
2. **代码寿命**：是下周可能重写的原型，还是要维护多年的系统？
3. **理解人数**：只有你一个人需要理解，还是整个团队长期共同维护？

例如：

- 个人副业项目、暂无用户：可以更多依赖测试和自动化，重点审查关键部分。
- 有用户的产品：bug 会真正伤害用户，审查和知识共享变得重要。
- 支付系统、核心业务逻辑：仅靠“测试通过”就发布，等于制造带绿色勾选的事故。

核心观点是：  
**审查规则应随风险变化，而不是机械照搬某类团队的经验。**

---

## 4. 代码审查真正要解决的是“理解意图”

AI 生成代码后，审查者常常成了“第一个真正读这段代码的人”。

文章引用 2026 年论文《AI Slop and Software Commons》，该论文分析了：

- **15 个 Reddit 和 Hacker News 讨论串**
- **1,154 条帖子**

其中一位开发者说，审查代理生成的 PR 时，感觉自己是“第一个看到这段代码的人”。

问题在于：

- 传统审查中，作者通常知道为什么这么改。
- AI PR 中，意图和推理过程往往没有被保留下来。
- 审查者必须重新构建“为什么要这样改”。

解决方向是：

- 让代理说明它想做什么。
- 记录它考虑过、排除过哪些方案。
- 在 PR 中保留决策日志。

这样可以减少审查者重建意图的成本。

---

## 5. AI 可以审查 AI，但不能完全替代人类判断

文章认为，使用 AI 审查 AI 是有价值的，但不是完整答案。

AI 审查能做的：

- 发现真实 bug
- 找出人类容易漏看的问题
- 不会因一天审查太多 PR 而疲劳

AI 审查不能完全做的：

- 判断“这个需求本身是否值得做”
- 判断“这是否是正确的产品或架构方向”
- 发现没人写进需求里的隐含风险
- 对线上事故承担责任

因此，AI 审查应被视为：

> 传感器，而不是最终裁决者。

最终合并责任仍应由人承担。

---

## 6. 多个不同 AI 审查工具比单一工具更有效

文章提到一个工程师在真实代码库上做的实验：

- 使用 4 个审查工具：
  - CodeRabbit
  - Sentry Seer
  - Greptile
  - Cursor BugBot
- 覆盖 **146 个真实 PR**
- 产生 **679 条发现**
- 持续约 **3 个半星期**

结果：

- 在 **617 个不同被标记位置**中，**93.4% 只被其中一个工具发现**
- **6% 被两个工具发现**
- 几乎没有被三个工具同时发现
- 没有任何一行被四个工具同时标记

这说明不同工具擅长发现不同类型问题：

- Greptile：正确性和架构问题，误报低
- CodeRabbit：覆盖面广，有一键修复
- Seer：擅长识别生产事故级别问题

结论是：

- 不必纠结“哪个 AI 审查工具最好”
- 高风险场景应使用两个或多个特性不同的工具
- 个人项目则一个好工具加真实测试通常足够

---

## 7. 人类的角色从“逐行审查”变为“系统监督”

作者认为，未来人类不会退出审查流程，而是上移一层。

过去人类做的是：

- 阅读每个 diff
- 找 bug
- 判断代码是否能合并

现在更合理的角色是：

- 抽样检查
- 审计 AI 审查系统
- 处理高风险路径
- 决定是否真正合并
- 判断需求和方向是否正确

作者自己的做法是：

- 用 Claude Code 或 Codex 对一批 PR 做初筛。
- 让它们判断哪些看起来安全、哪些需要更多工作、哪些高风险。
- 作者不会让 AI 自动合并，而是用 AI 结果来分配注意力。

这改变的不是“审查时间稍微变短”，而是整个审查时间的形态：  
**AI 帮助排序风险，人类把精力集中到最值得关注的地方。**

---

## 8. 极端案例：独立开发者一天 40 个 PR

文章提到前 Meta L8 工程师 Kun Chen：

- 作为独立开发者每天交付约 **40 个 PR**
- 并行运行 **20 到 30 个代理**
- 基本停止传统逐行代码审查
- 重点放在前期计划上
- 构建了自动审查门禁系统 “No Mistakes”

但作者强调，这并不代表他“不验证”：

- 他把意图提前写进详细计划。
- 代理按计划执行数小时。
- 自动系统负责合并前检查。
- 人类在代理卡住或风险升级时介入。

这个案例适合特定场景：  
**独立、高能力、低团队协作成本、无大型遗留系统。**

如果大团队照搬，可能会重现 Faros 数据中的高 churn、高缺陷率和审查崩溃。

---

## 9. 实际建议：按风险分层审查

作者给出的核心做法是：  
**不要对所有变更用同样深度审查，而是按出错成本分配审查资源。**

### 低风险变更

例如配置调整、样板代码：

- linter
- 自动测试
- 简单浏览即可

### 高风险变更

例如核心业务逻辑、支付、权限、安全路径：

- 类型检查
- 完整测试
- 两个不同 AI 审查工具
- 熟悉系统的人类审查
- 安全审查

重点不是“谁写的代码”，而是“这段代码出错会造成什么后果”。

---

## 10. 提高进入审查的门槛

面对大量代理 PR，团队不能无条件接收所有变更进入人工审查。

应要求提交前具备：

- 说明这个变更是为了什么
- diff 不应是几千行且没有解释
- 提供测试输出
- 证明测试确实运行过
- 保留关键决策和推理过程

这样可以避免审查者成为第一个重建意图的人。

文章还引用一项 2026 年研究：

- 分析 **33,707 个代理生成 PR**
- 约 **28% 的小型明确变更几乎能立即合并**
- 但代理面对主观反馈时容易“消失”或放弃后续沟通
- 另一篇论文发现，审查者放弃占被拒代理 PR 的 **38%**

因此团队应尽早识别高维护成本 PR，快速处理简单变更，及时拦截庞大且难以推进的变更。

---

## 11. 要特别审查测试变更和 CI

AI 代理常见失败模式之一是：

> 改坏了行为，然后把测试断言也改成匹配错误行为。

所以：

- 大量修改测试的 PR 应优先审查测试。
- 绿色测试并不代表行为正确。
- 代码覆盖率只能说明代码被执行，不代表测试能发现错误。
- mutation testing 更有价值，因为它能检查测试是否能发现错误逻辑。

同时，CI 必须保持严格：

警惕以下情况：

- 删除测试
- 跳过 lint
- 降低覆盖率阈值
- 重复已有 helper
- 把不可信用户输入直接送入 LLM prompt

尤其最后一点可能造成 prompt injection，风险未必直接体现在 diff 中，而是在未来真实数据进入系统时爆发。

---

## 12. 团队管理者应重新理解“产能”

对团队负责人来说，关键瓶颈已经不是写代码速度，而是：

> 可信的人能多快对变更建立信心。

如果因为 AI 提高了编码速度就裁减工程人员，可能只是把节省下来的成本转化为未来事故。

文章强调：

- QA 和审查工作会随着 AI 代码产出增加而增加。
- 高级工程师会承担更多审查税。
- 只看合并 PR 数量会掩盖真实风险。
- 开源维护者已经最早感受到大量“看似合理但空洞”的 AI 贡献带来的负担。
- 企业团队接下来也会面对同样问题。

优秀团队会把审查能力当作真实资源来管理，而不是当作 AI 自动释放出来的闲置时间。

---

## 13. 最终结论：写代码便宜了，理解代码没有

AI 代理让写代码越来越便宜，但理解代码、验证代码、为代码负责并没有变便宜。

不同场景应采取不同策略：

- **个人无用户项目**：可以依赖测试和自动化，轻量审查关键部分。
- **大型多人系统**：必须建立分层、证据驱动、多工具参与、有人负责合并的审查流程。

最重要的是不要混淆：

> “测试通过”不等于“有人理解这段代码做了什么以及为什么这样做”。

未来真正有优势的团队，不是生成最多代码的团队，而是建立了可信审查系统的团队。AI 没有改变工程师的责任：你仍然要交付已经被证明有效的代码，只是现在“证明它有效”成了工作的中心。

---

### 🤖 AI

# 代理式代码审查：文章精炼总结

AI 编码代理让“写代码”变得极快，但真正的瓶颈转移到了“能否信任这些代码”。因此，代码审查不但没有变得不重要，反而成为当前软件工程中最关键、最有杠杆作用的能力。

---

## 1. 代码生成变快了，审查成为新瓶颈

过去代码审查之所以有效，是因为**资深工程师读代码的速度通常快于初级工程师写代码的速度**。  
但现在 AI 代理可以在极短时间内生成上千行代码，而人类阅读和理解代码的速度并没有变快。

关键变化是：

- 过去瓶颈在“写代码”；
- 现在瓶颈在“确认代码是否正确、是否值得信任”；
- AI 生成的代码越多，审查压力越大；
- 代码审查从辅助流程变成了软件交付的核心环节。

作者强调，这不是反 AI。相反，他自己也使用 Claude Code、Codex 等工具帮助处理 PR，只是认为 AI 让审查的重要性上升了。

---

## 2. 2026 年数据：AI 提升产出，但也放大审查压力

多组数据都指向同一个结论：**AI 显著增加代码产出，但质量、可审查性和维护压力也同步恶化**。

### Faros AI 数据

Faros AI 跟踪了：

- 22,000 名开发者；
- 4,000 个团队；
- 数据来自 2026 年 3 月。

结果显示，团队高强度使用 AI 后：

- 代码 churn 上升 **861%**；
- 事件与 PR 的比例上升 **242.7%**；
- 单开发者缺陷率从 **9% 上升到 54%**；
- 中位审查时长上升 **441.5%**；
- 首次审查时间和平均审查时间大约翻倍；
- 零审查合并的 PR 增加 **31.3%**。

作者特别关注“零审查合并”这一点：并不是团队主动决定不审查，而是审查者跟不上代码产出速度，导致代码开始在没人读的情况下被合并。

### CodeRabbit 数据

CodeRabbit 研究了 2025 年 12 月的 470 个开源 PR：

- 320 个 AI 协作 PR；
- 150 个纯人工 PR。

发现 AI 相关改动的问题约为人工的 **1.7 倍**：

- 逻辑和正确性问题增加约 **75%**；
- 安全问题常见度为 **1.5 到 2 倍**；
- 可读性问题增加超过 **3 倍**。

这些问题并非随机，而是“可预测、可测量”的弱点，因此可以通过针对性的审查流程缓解。

### GitClear 数据

GitClear 的数据表明：

- 每日使用 AI 的开发者原始代码产出约为非 AI 用户的 **4 倍**；
- 但相较于自己一年前，真实生产力提升只有约 **12%**；
- 其中部分提升还可能来自样本偏差，因为更强的开发者更集中在 AI 用户群体中。

一句话概括：**代码量增加 4 倍，但交付价值只增加约十分之一，人类却仍要审查这 4 倍代码。**

### GitHub 数据

GitHub 报告称：

- Copilot Review 已运行超过 **6000 万次审查**；
- 不到一年增长 **10 倍**；
- 平台上超过 **五分之一** 的审查涉及代理。

这说明 AI 审查已不是小众实践，而是代码生产流程的一部分。

## 3. 不同团队面临的问题完全不同

文章强调，代码审查需要多少强度，取决于代码出问题后的影响范围，也就是“爆炸半径”。

主要取决于三个变量：

1. **出错后果**  
   是没人注意的小项目，还是涉及用户、资金、隐私数据？

2. **代码生命周期**  
   是下周可能重写的原型，还是要维护多年的核心系统？

3. **需要理解代码的人数**  
   是只有一个人维护，还是整个团队长期共同负责？

因此，“好审查”的标准不能一刀切。

---

## 4. 个人项目、成长中项目和大型系统需要不同策略

### 个人无用户项目

如果是一个人做的新项目，而且几乎没有用户：

- 可以更多依赖测试和自动化；
- 只重点审查真正关键的部分；
- 对重复、代码 churn 等问题可以更宽容。

但前提是：**测试必须真实有效**。  
跳过审查并不等于工作消失，只是把问题推迟到以后，并且可能以更高成本爆发。

### 项目开始有用户时

这是最危险的阶段。

很多团队仍沿用“个人项目时期”的宽松习惯，但此时代码 bug 已经会影响真实用户，团队成员也开始需要共享理解。  
如果没有及时升级审查流程，就很容易在事故复盘中发现问题。

### 大型组织和老代码库

对于维护多年、有大量用户的系统：

- 每个未经理解的变更都是未来事故的债务；
- 审查不仅要抓 bug，还要传递系统知识；
- AI 生成的大量代码会破坏原有审查机制。

Faros 数据中“成熟工程团队也被冲击”正是针对这种场景。

---

## 5. 现在代码审查真正要解决什么问题

传统审查的作用包括：

- 检查作者的推理；
- 找 bug；
- 让团队共享知识。

但 AI 生成代码时，模型的“推理过程”通常不会随代码一起提交。  
于是审查者常常成为**第一个真正读懂这段代码的人**。

文章引用一篇 2026 年论文《AI Slop and the Software Commons》，其中有开发者形容审查 AI PR 时，自己是“第一个用人眼看这段代码的人”。

这说明当前审查的关键难点是：**恢复缺失的意图**。

解决办法是让代理在 PR 中附带：

- 它想解决什么问题；
- 为什么这么改；
- 排除了哪些方案；
- 决策日志和测试证据。

这样审查者就不必从 diff 中重新猜测设计意图。

---

## 6. AI 审查工具有价值，但不能只依赖一个

作者认为，现在 AI 审查工具已经相当有用，但不同工具擅长发现的问题不同。

一项真实代码库实验运行了四个审查工具：

- CodeRabbit；
- Sentry Seer；
- Greptile；
- Cursor BugBot。

实验覆盖：

- 146 个真实 PR；
- 679 条发现；
- 持续三周半。

结果：

- 在 617 个不同被标记位置中，**93.4% 只被一个工具发现**；
- **6% 被两个工具发现**；
- 几乎没有被三个工具同时发现；
- 没有任何一处被四个工具同时发现。

这说明：

- 不同 AI 审查器像不同风格的审查者；
- 关键不是找“唯一最强工具”；
- 高风险场景应使用两个以上差异化工具；
- 四个同质模型不如两个互补模型。

例如：

- Greptile 擅长正确性和架构问题，误报低；
- CodeRabbit 覆盖广，并提供一键修复；
- Sentry Seer 更擅长生产事故严重性判断。

---

## 7. AI 是否应该承担更多审查？

作者认为，这是一个现实问题，而不是禁忌问题。

AI 审查确实有效：

- Anthropic 的审查结果中，被标记为错误的发现低于 **1%**；
- AI 不会疲劳；
- AI 能发现人类漏看的 bug；
- 人类审查者已经明显跟不上 PR 数量。

但 AI 不能替代人类做所有判断，尤其是：

- 这是不是应该做的改动；
- 是否符合产品方向；
- 是否会带来未写入需求中的隐患；
- 高风险路径是否值得承担风险。

因此，人类不是消失，而是从“逐行审查者”变成“审查系统的负责人”。

作者称之为：  
**human in the loop 变成 human on the loop**，即人类从流程内部的每一步参与者，变成监督和掌控整个审查系统的人。

---

## 8. 作者自己的实践：AI 做分流，人类做最终决定

作者在自己的开源项目中使用 Claude Code 或 Codex 对一批 PR 做初筛：

- 哪些看起来安全；
- 哪些需要更多工作；
- 哪些风险较高。

但他不会让 AI 自动合并，也不会懒惰地接受 AI 的判断。  
AI 的作用是帮助他分配注意力：

- 低风险 PR 快速确认；
- 高风险 PR 认真审查；
- 最终合并决定仍由人类负责。

这不是“把旧审查流程加速一点”，而是把审查时间改造成“风险排序后的注意力分配”。

---

## 9. 极端案例：单人开发者每天 40 个 PR

文章提到前 Meta L8 工程师 Kun Chen。

他的工作方式是：

- 作为单人开发者每天交付约 **40 个 PR**；
- 并行运行 **20 到 30 个代理**；
- 将主要精力放在详细计划上；
- 让代理根据计划运行数小时；
- 使用自动审查门禁“No Mistakes”检查代码；
- 当代理卡住时再人工介入。

重点不是他完全不验证，而是验证方式前移和自动化：

- 人类先写清楚意图和计划；
- 机器执行和逐行检查；
- 人类处理升级问题。

但作者提醒，这种模式适合特定条件：单人、无大型团队、没有十年老系统和大量用户。  
如果大型团队照搬，可能会直接复现 Faros 数据中的质量问题。

---

## 10. 实际应该怎么做：按风险分层审查

作者建议：不要对所有代码都用同样深度的审查，而是根据“出错代价”分配审查资源。

### 按风险分层，而不是按作者分层

例如：

- 配置小改动：linter、测试、简单看一眼即可；
- 核心业务逻辑变更：类型检查、测试、两个不同 AI 审查器、系统负责人审查、安全检查都要上。

不要把重审查浪费在样板代码上，也不要因为测试绿了就放过高风险改动。

---

## 11. 提前拦截高维护成本 PR

2026 年一篇研究《Early-Stage Prediction of Review Effort》分析了：

- 33,707 个代理编写的 PR。

发现：

- AI 代理擅长小而明确的修改；
- 约 **28%** 的 PR 几乎可以立即合并；
- 但一旦收到主观反馈，代理很容易“消失”或放弃后续沟通；
- 另一篇 2026 年论文发现，审查者放弃占被拒 AI PR 的 **38%**。

因此可以建立“断路器”：

- 根据文件类型、patch 大小等低成本信号；
- 在人工介入前预测哪些 PR 会很难维护；
- 简单 PR 快速通过；
- 大而混乱的 PR 不要让人类浪费一小时后才发现无法推进。

---

## 12. 提高进入审查的门槛

作者认为，解决审查过载不是锁死仓库，而是拒绝审查缺少证据的改动。

提交审查前应要求：

- 说明改动目的；
- diff 不应是无注释的 3500 行巨型变更；
- 提供测试输出；
- 证明测试确实运行过；
- 说明关键设计选择。

这样可以避免审查者成为“第一个理解代码的人”。

---

## 13. 控制 PR 大小，重点审查测试改动

AI 生成的 PR 往往更大。Faros 数据显示，代理 PR 平均大 **51%**。  
而 PR 越大，越难审查，也越容易被直接拒绝或草率盖章。

因此要明确要求代理：

- 生成小 PR；
- 拆成小提交；
- 保持 diff 可读。

同时，作者特别强调：**要比代码更认真地审查测试改动**。

常见风险是：

- AI 改了业务行为；
- 然后把测试断言也改成匹配错误行为；
- CI 依然显示绿色。

所以，如果一个 PR 修改了大量测试，要优先检查这些测试是否仍然验证了正确行为。  
必要时可使用 mutation testing，因为覆盖率只能说明代码被执行过，而 mutation testing 能检查测试是否真的能发现错误。

---

## 14. CI 是不能被说服的“硬墙”

AI 可能为了让代码通过而削弱 CI，例如：

- 删除测试；
- 跳过 lint；
- 降低覆盖率门槛；
- 复制已有 helper；
- 将不可信输入直接送入 LLM prompt。

其中，最后一点尤其危险：  
如果用户输入被直接传入 LLM 调用，可能产生 prompt injection 风险，而这种漏洞未必能直接从 diff 中看出来。

作者提醒：  
确定性门禁是流水线中少数不会被“自信解释”说服的部分，因此必须保持严格。

---

## 15. 最终合并必须由人类负责

AI 审查只能作为传感器，而不是判决者。

原因很简单：

- 模型不会被叫醒处理线上事故；
- 模型不能承担责任；
- 点击 merge 的人必须为结果负责。

当 AI 用很自信的语气说“looks good”时，它给的是“借来的信心”，而不是最终责任。

---

## 16. 对团队管理者的启示

对于团队负责人来说，真正瓶颈已经不是代码生成速度，而是：

> 可信的人类能多快对变更建立信心。

如果因为“AI 让我们更快了”就削减负责审查和质量的人，短期看似节省成本，长期很可能变成事故。

Faros 报告指出：

- 代码产出上升的同时，QA 和审查工作也会上升；
- 高级工程师的审查负担会显著加重；
- 只看合并 PR 数的指标会掩盖真实风险。

开源维护者最早感受到这个问题：大量看似合理但空洞的贡献会消耗真实的 triage 时间。企业也会遇到同样问题。

优秀团队会把审查能力当作稀缺资源来管理，而不是当成 AI 释放出来的闲置容量。

---

## 17. 最终结论：写代码便宜了，理解代码没有

AI 让写代码越来越便宜，但理解代码、验证代码、为代码负责仍然昂贵。  
未来表现最好的团队，不会是生成代码最多的团队，而是建立了可信审查系统的团队。

文章最后强调：

- 个人无用户项目可以更轻量；
- 大型多人系统必须建立分层、证据驱动、异构 AI 辅助、人类负责的审查流程；
- 不要把“测试通过”误认为“有人理解了这段代码为什么存在”；
- 软件工程的核心正在从“写出代码”转向“证明代码能工作”。

用一句话概括：  
**代理没有改变开发者交付可靠代码的责任，只是让“证明代码可靠”成为工作的中心。**
