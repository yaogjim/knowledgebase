###### Abstract

Generative AI (GenAI) has reshaped software system design by introducing foundation models as pre-trained subsystems that redefine architectures and operations. The emerging challenge is no longer model fine-tuning but context engineering—how systems capture, structure, and govern external knowledge, memory, tools, and human input to enable trustworthy reasoning. Existing practices such as prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and tool integration remain fragmented, producing transient artefacts that limit traceability and accountability. This paper proposes a file-system abstraction for context engineering, inspired by the Unix notion that “everything is a file.” The abstraction offers a persistent, governed infrastructure for managing heterogeneous context artefacts through uniform mounting, metadata, and access control. Implemented within the open-source AIGNE framework, the architecture realises a verifiable context-engineering pipeline, comprising the Context Constructor, Loader, and Evaluator, that assembles, delivers, and validates context under token constraints. As GenAI becomes an active collaborator in decision support, humans play a central role as curators, verifiers, and co-reasoners. The proposed architecture establishes a reusable foundation for accountable and human-centred AI co-work, demonstrated through two exemplars: an agent with memory and an MCP-based GitHub assistant. The implementation within the AIGNE framework demonstrates how the architecture can be operationalised in developer and industrial settings, supporting verifiable, maintainable, and industry-ready GenAI systems.

生成式人工智能 (GenAI) 通过引入基础模型作为预训练子系统，重新定义了软件系统的架构和操作，从而重塑了软件系统设计。新兴挑战已不再是模型微调，而是上下文工程——即系统如何捕获、组织和管理外部知识、记忆、工具和人类输入，以实现可信推理。现有实践（如提示工程、检索增强生成 (RAG) 和工具集成）仍较为零散，产生的临时人工制品限制了可追溯性和可问责性。本文提出了一种用于上下文工程的文件系统抽象，受 Unix 中“万物皆文件”理念的启发。该抽象通过统一挂载、元数据和访问控制，提供了一个持久且受管理的基础设施，用于管理异构上下文人工制品。该架构在开源的 AIGNE 框架中实现，构建了一个可验证的上下文工程流程，包括上下文构造器、加载器和评估器，能够在 token 约束下组装、交付和验证上下文。 随着生成式 AI（GenAI）成为决策支持中的积极协作者，人类作为策展人、验证者和共同推理者发挥着核心作用。所提出的架构为可问责且以人类为中心的 AI 协作建立了一个可复用的基础，通过两个示例进行了展示：一个具有记忆能力的智能体和一个基于 MCP 的 GitHub 助手。 AIGNE 框架中的实现展示了该架构如何在开发者和工业场景中实现可操作化，支持可验证、可维护的以及行业就绪的 GenAI 系统

## I Introduction

Context engineering is emerging as a central concern in software architecture for Generative AI (GenAI) and Agentic systems \[bleigh2025context, mei2025surveycontextengineeringlarge, LangChainContextEngineering2024\]. It refers to the process of capturing, structuring, and governing external knowledge, memory, tools, and human input so that reasoning by large language models (LLMs) and agents is grounded in the right information, constraints, and provenance. In contrast to prompt engineering, which focuses on crafting individual instructions, context engineering focuses on the entire information lifecycle, from selection, retrieval, filtering, construction, to compression, evaluation and refresh, ensuring that GenAI systems and agents remain coherent, efficient, and verifiable over time.

上下文工程正成为生成式人工智能（GenAI）和智能体系统软件架构中的核心关注点 \[bleigh2025context, mei2025surveycontextengineeringlarge, LangChainContextEngineering2024\] 。它指的是捕获、结构化和管理外部知识、记忆、工具和人类输入的过程，以使大型语言模型（LLMs）和智能体的推理基于正确的信息、约束条件和出处。与专注于精心设计单个指令的提示工程不同，上下文工程关注整个信息生命周期，从选择、检索、过滤、构建，到压缩、评估和更新，确保生成式人工智能系统和智能体在长期内保持一致性、高效性和可验证性。

Recent industrial frameworks such as LangChain have begun to articulate context engineering as a structured process within agent architectures \[LangChainContextEngineering2024\]. Four key stages of context engineering are identified. Agents first write contextual information into a shared memory or store, select the most relevant elements for a given task, compress the selected context to fit model constraints, and isolate the final subset across agents for reasoning. These industrial practices highlight the growing recognition that context management has become a central architectural concern. Similar pipelines appear in AutoGen \[AutoGenMemory2024\], and other related frameworks that support tool use and memory augmentation \[AnthropicContextEngineering2024\]. However, these solutions remain ad hoc and implementation-driven. They lack a unified architectural foundation to ensure traceability, governance, or systematic handling of evolving context. Consequently, context artefacts generated during these steps are often transient, opaque, and unverifiable, raising challenges of context rot \[TrychromaContextRot2024\] and knowledge drift in industrial-setting GenAI systems \[laban2025llmslostmultiturnconversation\].

Wait, no, the user wants the translated content, but I need to replace the English words inside the spans with their Chinese translations. Let me correct that. The original spans are around the English verbs, so in the translation, those spans should contain the Chinese translations of "write", "select", etc. So: Recent industrial frameworks such as LangChain have begun to articulate context engineering as a structured process within agent architectures \[LangChainContextEngineering2024\]. Four key stages of context engineering are identified. Agents first 写入 contextual information into a shared memory or store, 选择 the most relevant elements for a given task, 压缩 the selected context to fit model constraints, and 隔离 the final subset across agents for reasoning.

Yes, that makes more sense. The spans should contain the translated Chinese words where the original had the English ones. The rest of the structure, including the citations and spans for the key stages, is preserved.Recent industrial frameworks such as LangChain have begun to articulate context engineering as a structured process within agent architectures \[LangChainContextEngineering2024\].

However, these solutions remain ad hoc and implementation-driven. They lack a unified architectural foundation to ensure traceability, governance, or systematic handling of evolving context. 因此，在这些步骤中生成的上下文工件往往是短暂的、不透明的且不可验证的，带来了上下文衰减 \[TrychromaContextRot2024\] 和工业环境下生成式 AI 系统中知识漂移的挑战 \[laban2025llmslostmultiturnconversation\] 。

GenAI introduces new architectural constraints in AI engineering \[SAML\]. Foundation models act as pre-trained subsystems with limited token windows that constrain reasoning. This bounded working memory propagates upward through the architecture, shaping how context must be selected, modularised, compressed, and loaded at runtime. As GenAI becomes an active collaborator across domains such as education, healthcare, and decision support, humans increasingly co-work with AI \[RAGHuman, xu2025ragopsoperatingmanagingretrievalaugmented\] on reasoning and decision-making tasks. Yet GenAI systems may produce inaccurate or misleading outputs due to limited contextual awareness and evolving data sources. Architectural mechanisms are therefore needed to govern how persistent knowledge (long-term memory) transitions into bounded context (short-term window) in a traceable, verifiable, and human-aware manner, ensures that human judgment and tacit knowledge remain embedded within the system’s evolving context for reasoning and evaluation.

GenAI 在人工智能工程中引入了新的架构约束 \[SAML\] 。基础模型作为具有有限 token 窗口的预训练子系统，限制了推理能力。这种有限的工作记忆通过架构向上传播，塑造了上下文在运行时必须如何被选择、模块化、压缩和加载。随着 GenAI 成为教育、医疗和决策支持等领域的积极协作方，人类与 AI 在推理和决策任务中越来越多地协作 \[RAGHuman, xu2025ragopsoperatingmanagingretrievalaugmented\] 。然而，由于上下文感知能力有限且数据源不断变化，GenAI 系统可能会产生不准确或误导性的输出。因此，需要架构机制来管理持久知识（长期记忆）如何以可追溯、可验证且具人类意识的方式过渡到有限上下文（短期窗口），确保人类判断和隐性知识在系统不断演变的上下文中保持嵌入，以支持推理和评估。

This paper introduces a file-system abstraction as an architectural foundation, as a stepping stone for context engineering, inspired by the Unix philosophy that “everything is a file” \[Unix\]. The abstraction provides a persistent, hierarchical, and governed environment where heterogeneous context sources, such as memory, tools, external knowledge, and human contributions, are mounted and accessed uniformly. Building upon this infrastructure, the paper extends file system into a context-engineering pipeline that operationalises context construction under explicit architectural design constraints with the token window. The pipeline performs selection, compression, and incremental streaming of context to ensure that bounded context capacity is used efficiently and transparently.

本文介绍了一种文件系统抽象作为架构基础，作为上下文工程的垫脚石，其灵感来源于 Unix 哲学中“一切皆文件”的理念 \[Unix\] 。该抽象提供了一个持久、分层且受管理的环境，其中异构上下文源（如内存、工具、外部知识和人类贡献）被挂载并统一访问。在此基础上，本文将文件系统扩展为一个上下文工程流水线，该流水线在显式架构设计约束下通过 token 窗口实现上下文构建的操作化。该流水线执行上下文的选择、压缩和增量流式处理，以确保有限的上下文容量被高效且透明地使用。

## II Background and Related WorkII 背景与相关工作

The emergence of agentic Generative AI systems has given rise to an operating-system paradigm for LLMs (LLM-as-OS), which conceptualises the LLM as a kernel orchestrating context, memory, tools, and agents. AIOS project \[ge2023llmosagentsapps\] operationalises this paradigm through OS-like primitives for scheduling, resource allocation, and memory management for multi-agent systems \[mei2025aiosllmagentoperating\]. Recent work on further extends this view by proposing an LLM-based semantic file system that enables natural-language–driven file operations and semantic indexing \[shi2025lsfs\] MemGPT \[packer2024memgptllmsoperatingsystems\] introduces a memory hierarchy that coordinates both short-term (context window) and long-term (external storage) memory. While the LLM-as-OS paradigm provides an intuitive high-level conceptual model, it lacks a software-architectural abstraction for how context is structured, shared, and governed. In particular, existing implementations often treat memory, retrieval, and tool use as independent components rather than a coherent infrastructure.

代理型生成式 AI 系统的出现催生了适用于大语言模型（LLM）的操作系统范式（LLM-as-OS），该范式将大语言模型概念化为一个编排上下文、内存、工具和代理的内核。AIOS 项目 \[ge2023llmosagentsapps\] 通过为多代理系统提供类似操作系统的调度、资源分配和内存管理原语，实现了这一范式 \[mei2025aiosllmagentoperating\] 。最近的研究进一步扩展了这一观点，提出了一种基于大语言模型的语义文件系统，该系统支持自然语言驱动的文件操作和语义索引 \[shi2025lsfs\] 。MemGPT \[packer2024memgptllmsoperatingsystems\] 引入了一种内存层次结构，用于协调短期（上下文窗口）和长期（外部存储）内存。尽管 LLM-as-OS 范式提供了一种直观的高层概念模型，但它缺乏关于上下文如何被结构化、共享和管理的软件架构抽象。 特别是，现有的实现常常将内存、检索和工具使用视为独立的组件，而非连贯的基础设施。

In parallel, context engineering \[LangChainContextEngineering2024, hua2025contextengineering20context\] has emerged as a central element in design of Generative AI system. Unlike traditional prompt engineering, which considers context as just a fixed block of text, context engineering treats it as a living, structured mix of instructions, external knowledge, tool definitions, memory, system state, and user queries. Frameworks such as LangChain \[LangChainDeepAgents2025\], AutoGen \[AutoGenMemory2024\] provide partial support through modular components for memory and tool orchestration, but they lack unified mechanisms for traceability, governance, and lifecycle management of context artefacts. Emerging link-based mechanisms \[bleigh2025context\] treats context as interconnected, discoverable resources, highlighting the need for an unified, verifiable infrastructure to manage such dynamic context. Recent survey \[mei2025surveycontextengineeringlarge\] from academia also confirms that current approaches are fragmented and identified gaps in verification and lifecycle support. An integrated framework is proposed for bridging context construction and retrieval \[dai2025onepiecebringingcontextengineering\] but note the absence of a verifiable architectural foundation.

与此同时，上下文工程 \[LangChainContextEngineering2024, hua2025contextengineering20context\] 已成为生成式 AI 系统设计中的核心要素。与传统的提示工程（后者仅将上下文视为固定文本块）不同，上下文工程将其视为指令、外部知识、工具定义、记忆、系统状态和用户查询的鲜活、结构化混合体。LangChain \[LangChainDeepAgents2025\] 、AutoGen \[AutoGenMemory2024\] 等框架通过模块化组件为记忆和工具编排提供了部分支持，但缺乏对上下文制品的可追溯性、治理和生命周期管理的统一机制。新兴的基于链接的机制 \[bleigh2025context\] 将上下文视为相互关联、可发现的资源，强调需要一个统一、可验证的基础设施来管理此类动态上下文。 来自学术界的最近一项调查 \[mei2025surveycontextengineeringlarge\] 也证实了当前的方法是零散的，并且指出了在验证和生命周期支持方面存在的不足。 提出了一个集成框架，用于桥接上下文构建和检索 \[dai2025onepiecebringingcontextengineering\] 但需要注意缺乏可验证的架构基础。

Industry and open-source efforts have converged on long-term memory as a critical capability for agentic systems. Existing solutions can be roughly categorized into embedding based solutions, like mem0 \[mem0\] and Letta (formerly MemGPT) \[LettaAI2025\], and Knowledge Graph (KG) based solutions, like Zep/Graphiti \[rasmussen2025zeptemporalknowledgegraph\] and Cognee \[markovic2025optimizinginterfaceknowledgegraphs\]. However, across these solutions, context governance, access control, and multi-agent sharing remain largely ad hoc. Most frameworks focus on storage and retrieval optimization rather than architectural composability or verifiable traceability.

行业和开源领域的努力已汇聚到将长期记忆作为智能体系统的关键能力。现有解决方案大致可分为基于嵌入的解决方案（如 mem0 \[mem0\] 和 Letta（原 MemGPT） \[LettaAI2025\] ）以及基于知识图谱（KG）的解决方案（如 Zep/Graphiti \[rasmussen2025zeptemporalknowledgegraph\] 和 Cognee \[markovic2025optimizinginterfaceknowledgegraphs\] ）。然而，在这些解决方案中，上下文治理、访问控制和多智能体共享仍然在很大程度上缺乏系统性设计。大多数框架侧重于存储和检索优化，而非架构可组合性或可验证的可追溯性。

Beyond architectural paradigms, growing attention has been paid to the dynamics of human–AI co-work, where humans and AI agents jointly perform reasoning, assessment, and decision-making tasks. Recent studies show that combining human judgment with AI inference can enhance performance when tasks require contextual understanding, ethical reasoning, or tacit domain knowledge \[designRAG, Lindner2024HumanAICollaboration, CHI2019\].

除了架构范式之外，人机协作的动态越来越受关注，在这种协作中，人类和 AI 代理共同执行推理、评估和决策任务。最近的研究表明，当任务需要情境理解、伦理推理或隐性领域知识时，将人类判断与 AI 推理相结合可以提升表现 \[designRAG, Lindner2024HumanAICollaboration, CHI2019\] 。

The file system abstraction proposed in this paper aligns with the broader LLM-as-OS paradigm. It provides a persistent and governed infrastructure for mounting and managing heterogeneous context resources. By aligning with core software-architectural principles, including modularity, encapsulation, separation of concerns, and traceability, the file system transforms context engineering from ad hoc practice into a systematic, verifiable, and reusable infrastructure. Human roles are directly embed into the context-engineering architecture, ensuring that tacit knowledge and ethical judgment remain integral parts of system reasoning and evaluation.

本文提出的文件系统抽象与更广泛的以大语言模型(LLM)作为操作系统(LLM - as - OS)的范式一致。它为挂载和管理异构上下文资源提供了持久且受管控的基础设施。通过遵循模块化、封装、关注点分离和可追溯性等核心软件架构原则，该文件系统将上下文工程从临时实践转变为系统化、可验证且可复用的基础设施。人类角色被直接嵌入到上下文工程架构中，确保隐性知识和伦理判断仍然是系统推理和评估中不可或缺的组成部分。

## III File system as Infrastructure for ContextIII 文件系统作为上下文的基础设施

The file system provides the foundational infrastructure that enables systematic context engineering in GenAI systems.Within this environment, agents and human experts function analogously to operating-system processes, performing file-style operations such as reading, writing, and searching on mounted context resources. The file system defines a uniform namespace and a consistent set of basic operations that together enable scalable coordination between autonomous and human actors. The overall architecture of the proposed infrastructure is represented in Figure [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.05470v1#S3.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ III File system as Infrastructure for Context ‣ Everything is Context: Agentic File System Abstraction for Context Engineering"). This architectural abstraction aligns with established software engineering first principles. Concepts such as abstraction, modularity, encapsulation, separation of concerns, and composability shape how context resources are represented, accessed, and evolved. By applying these principles, the file system transforms the complexity of heterogeneous context into a structured, verifiable, and extensible environment for human–AI co-work. The file system operationalises LLM-as-Operating-System paradigm by transforming the metaphor into a concrete software architecture design.

文件系统提供了基础架构，支持生成式 AI（GenAI）系统中的系统性上下文工程。在此环境中，智能体和人类专家的作用类似于操作系统进程，在挂载的上下文资源上执行读取、写入和搜索等文件式操作。文件系统定义了统一命名空间和一致的基本操作集合，共同实现自主主体与人类主体之间的可扩展协调。所提议架构的整体架构如图 [1](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.05470v1#S3.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ III File system as Infrastructure for Context ‣ Everything is Context: Agentic File System Abstraction for Context Engineering") 所示。这种架构抽象符合成熟的软件工程基本原则。抽象、模块化、封装、关注点分离和可组合性等概念塑造了上下文资源的表示、访问和演进方式。通过应用这些原则，文件系统将异构上下文的复杂性转化为一个结构化、可验证且可扩展的人机协作环境。该文件系统通过将“大语言模型（LLM）作为操作系统”（ LLM-as-Operating-System ）范式从隐喻转化为具体的软件架构设计，使其得以实现。

Figure 1: File system as a unifying abstraction for context engineering. 图1：文件系统作为上下文工程的统一抽象。

#### III-1 Abstraction

The file system implements the SE principle of abstraction, providing a uniform interface that hides the heterogeneity of underlying context sources. Regardless of whether a resource is a knowledge graph, a memory store, or a human-curated note, it is represented through a standardised file interface. Because the file system is schema-driven, heterogeneous structures—including REST/OpenAPI resources, GraphQL types, MCP tools, memory stores, or external APIs—can be automatically projected into the namespace. This avoids integration code and turns the file system into a universal semantic interface. This allows agents to reason over diverse context types without knowing their physical format, storage mechanism, or retrieval logic.

该文件系统实现了 SE 原则中的抽象（abstraction），提供了一个统一接口，隐藏了底层上下文源的异构性。无论资源是知识图谱、内存存储还是人工整理的笔记，都通过标准化文件接口进行表示。由于该文件系统是基于模式的（schema-driven），异构结构（包括 REST/OpenAPI 资源、GraphQL 类型、MCP 工具、内存存储或外部 API）可被自动映射到命名空间中。这避免了集成代码，将文件系统转变为通用语义接口。这使得智能体能够对不同类型的上下文进行推理，而无需了解其物理格式、存储机制或检索逻辑。

#### III-2 Modularity and EncapsulationIII-2 模块化和封装

The architecture realizes modularity by decomposing the environment into independently manageable context resources. Each resource is encapsulated as a mounted component with well-defined boundaries and metadata. This encapsulation isolates the internal logic or backend implementation of each resource while exposing only the minimal set of operations required for integration. Thus, changes in one component, for example, swapping a relational database for a vector store, do not propagate across other components in the system. These capabilities eliminate the need to hard-code extensive tool descriptions that would otherwise overload the model’s token window. New context sources can be mounted dynamically, similar to Unix file systems, allowing agents to treat external services, tools, or databases as part of a unified addressable space.

该架构通过将环境分解为可独立管理的上下文资源来实现 模块化 。每个资源都被封装为一个挂载的组件，具有明确的边界和元数据。这种 封装 隔离了每个资源的内部逻辑或后端实现，同时仅暴露集成所需的最小操作集。因此，对一个组件的修改（例如，将关系型数据库替换为向量存储）不会在系统的其他组件中传播。这些能力消除了硬编码大量工具描述的需求，否则这些描述会使模型的 token 窗口过载。新的上下文源可以像 Unix 文件系统一样动态挂载，允许代理将外部服务、工具或数据库视为统一可寻址空间的一部分。

#### III-3 Separation of Concerns

Following the SE principle of separation of concerns, the file system distinguishes between data, tools, and governance layers. Non-executable files, such as config.yaml or experiment\_results.csv, serve as data or knowledge resources, while executable artefacts such as analyser.py or simulate.sh represent active tools. This clear distinction ensures that agents and human experts can interpret intent and behaviour correctly, applying appropriate verification and execution strategies. Separation of concerns also extends to governance: access control, log, and metadata management are handled through dedicated mechanisms that remain independent of the functional logic of retrieval or reasoning.

遵循软件工程（SE）中的 关注点分离 原则，文件系统区分数据、工具和治理三个层次。不可执行文件（如 config.yaml 或 experiment\_results.csv ）作为数据或知识资源，而可执行制品（如 analyser.py 或 simulate.sh ）则代表活跃的工具。这种清晰的区分确保智能体和人类专家能够正确解读意图和行为，并应用适当的验证和执行策略。关注点分离原则也延伸到治理层面：访问控制、日志和元数据管理通过专用机制处理，这些机制独立于检索或推理的功能逻辑。

#### III-4 Traceability and VerifiabilityIII-4 可追溯性与可验证性

Every interaction with the file system, whether initiated by an agent or a human, is logged as a transaction in the persistent context repository. This enforces traceability that enables the reconstruction of context provenance and accountability of actions. Coupled with structured metadata, these logs support verifiability by allowing changes, reasoning steps, and tool invocations to be audited retrospectively. This ensures that the context pipeline is not only functional but also transparent and auditable.

与文件系统的每次交互，无论由代理还是人类发起，都作为事务记录在持久化上下文仓库中。这强化了 可追溯性 ，能够重建上下文溯源并明确行为的可问责性。结合结构化元数据，这些日志支持 可验证性 ，通过允许对变更、推理步骤和工具调用进行追溯审计。这确保了上下文流程不仅功能完善，而且透明且可审计。

#### III-5 Composability and EvolvabilityIII-5 可组合性与可演化性

The file system achieves composability by defining a consistent namespace and interoperable metadata schema across all mounted resources. Context elements can be combined, queried, or integrated into higher-level reasoning processes without additional integration code. Evolvability is realised through a plugin architecture that allows new backends, such as full-text indexers, vector databases, or knowledge graphs to be mounted seamlessly without modifying the other components.

文件系统通过在所有挂载的资源中定义一致的命名空间和可互操作的元数据模式，实现了 可组合性 。上下文元素可以在无需额外集成代码的情况下被组合、查询或集成到更高级别的推理过程中。 可演化性 通过插件架构实现，该架构允许新的后端（例如全文索引器、向量数据库或知识图谱）无缝挂载，而无需修改其他组件。

Beyond standard file operations, the abstraction can associate each file or directory with meta-defined actions. These actions specify callable behaviours discoverable by agents, ranging from analytical functions, including summarisation, validation, and synchronisation, to domain-specific transformations. Actions elevate each file or directory into an active node, allowing agents to execute tools, transformations or service calls directly through the file system interface.

除了标准文件操作之外，该抽象可以将每个文件或目录与元定义的操作相关联。这些操作指定了可供代理发现的可调用行为，范围从分析功能（包括总结、验证和同步）到特定领域的转换。这些操作将每个文件或目录提升为活动节点，使代理能够通过文件系统接口直接执行工具、转换或服务调用。

## IV Persistent Context Repository: History and Memory LifecycleIV 持久化上下文代码仓库: 历史与内存生命周期

Large language models are inherently stateless: once a session ends, all contextual information is lost. To sustain coherent reasoning across sessions, a GenAI system requires an external, persistent memory repository that captures, structures, and evolves context over time. The Persistent Context Repository enabled by the File System fulfills this role. It unifies history, memory, and scratchpad into a continuous lifecycle, ensuring that both short-term and long-term contextual knowledge remain accessible, traceable, and up to date.

大型语言模型本质上是无状态的：一旦会话结束，所有上下文信息都会丢失。为了在会话间维持连贯的推理能力，生成式人工智能（GenAI）系统需要一个外部的、持久的记忆存储库，该存储库能够捕获、组织并随时间演进上下文。由文件系统支持的 持久上下文存储库 承担了这一角色。它将历史、记忆和临时存储区统一到一个连续的生命周期中，确保短期和长期上下文知识都可访问、可追溯且保持最新。

When an interaction occurs, raw data are first appended to History. Summarisation, embedding and indexing transforms these records into Memory representations optimized for retrieval and reasoning. During reasoning, temporary information are written to Scratchpads, which may be selectively inserted into Memory or archived in History after validation. This layered design ensures that all context resources remain both traceable and reusable across agents and sessions.

当发生交互时，原始数据首先被附加到 History 。 Summarisation 、 embedding 和 indexing 将这些记录转换为 Memory 表示形式，以优化检索和推理。在推理过程中，临时信息被写入 Scratchpads ，这些信息在验证后可能会被有选择地插入 Memory 或归档到 History 。这种分层设计确保所有上下文资源在代理和会话中都可追溯且可复用。

![Refer to caption](Figures/HistoryMemory.png)

Figure 2: Lifecycle of History, Memory and Scratchpad 图2：历史、记忆与暂存区的生命周期

These components differ in persistence: history is global and permanent; memory is agent-specific or session-specific, persistent but mutable; and scratchpads are transient yet auditable. Short-term context, assembled dynamically within the model’s token window, functions like working memory. Long-term context, by contrast, must reside outside the model and be selectively included when needed.

这些组件在持久性方面有所不同：历史是全局且永久的；记忆是代理特定或会话特定的，持久但可变；临时存储区是短暂但可审计的。短期上下文在模型的 token 窗口内动态构建，其作用类似于工作记忆。相比之下，长期上下文必须存在于模型外部，并在需要时被选择性地包含。

The file system enables provenance through timestamps, version control, and access policies. Each transformation, from history to memory, or from scratchpad to memory, is logged as a verifiable state transition. Each artefact carries its creation context, ownership, and lineage, enabling verifiable reconstruction of the reasoning process. This makes the repository not only a data store but also a traceability infrastructure that aligns context management with software engineering principles of modularity and traceability.

文件系统通过时间戳、版本控制和访问策略实现溯源。从历史记录到记忆，或从临时记录到记忆的每次转换都被记录为可验证的状态转换。每个工件都携带其创建上下文、所有权和谱系，从而能够对推理过程进行可验证的重建。这使得代码仓库不仅是一个数据存储，更是一个可追溯的基础设施，将上下文管理与软件工程的模块化和可追溯性原则相结合。

### IV-A History: Immutable Source of TruthIV-A 历史：不可变的事实源

History records all raw interactions between users, agents, and the environment. Each input, output, and intermediate reasoning step is logged immutable and enriched with metadata such as timestamp, origin, and model version. History acts as a verifiable source of truth. It can span multiple agents and sessions, forming a shared global data record accessible through the file system namespace (e.g., /context/history/). By maintaining complete traces, the system preserves the provenance of reasoning and enables post-hoc analysis, debugging, and compliance verification.

历史记录用户、代理和环境之间的所有原始交互。每个输入、输出和中间推理步骤都被不可变地记录，并补充有元数据（如时间戳、来源和模型版本）。历史作为可验证的事实来源。它可跨越多个代理和会话，形成一个可通过文件系统命名空间访问的共享全局数据记录（例如： /context/history/ ）。通过保留完整的追踪记录，系统保留推理的出处，并支持事后分析、调试和合规性验证。

### IV-B Memory: Structured and Indexed ViewsIV-B 内存：结构化和索引化视图

From the context management perspective, memory can be classified along temporal, structural, and representational dimensions.

从上下文管理的角度来看，内存可以按照时间、结构和表征维度进行分类。

- Temporal: How long the memory persists.
 
 • 时间性：内存持续的时长。
- Structural: Size or abstraction level of what’s stored, token-level, fact-level, or summary-level.
 
 • 结构：存储内容的大小或抽象级别，token 级别、事实级别或摘要级别。
- Representational: How the memory is modelled internally, as raw text, vector embeddings, structured triples, or summaries.
 
 • 表示形式：内存如何在内部建模，例如原始文本、向量嵌入、结构化三元组或摘要。

While the short-term versus long-term distinction originates from human cognition, practical GenAI systems manage a spectrum of memory types that balance persistence with dynamism \[wang2024limitssurveytechniquesextend\], such as episodic memory (task-bounded summaries) and fact memory (persistent atomic facts). Semantic or induced memory captures higher-level embeddings derived from clustering or summarisation. Each type serves a complementary role within the GenAI reasoning process, ranging from ephemeral reasoning support to enduring knowledge preservation, and is exposed through a consistent namespace hierarchy. Multiple memory types may coexist, as illustrated in Table [I](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.05470v1#S4.T1 "TABLE I ‣ IV-B Memory: Structured and Indexed Views ‣ IV Persistent Context Repository: History and Memory Lifecycle ‣ Everything is Context: Agentic File System Abstraction for Context Engineering").

虽然短期与长期的区分源于人类认知，但实际的生成式 AI（GenAI）系统管理着一系列平衡持久性与动态性的内存类型 \[wang2024limitssurveytechniquesextend\] ，例如情景记忆（任务有限的摘要）和事实记忆（持久的原子事实）。语义或诱导式记忆捕获来自聚类或摘要的更高级别嵌入。每种类型在生成式 AI 推理过程中发挥互补作用，从短暂的推理支持到持久的知识保存，并且通过一致的命名空间层次结构呈现。多种内存类型可能共存，如表 I 所示。

Memory entries are agent-specific and governed through shared metadata and access-control rules. Each memory item maintains a reference to its historical source, ensuring traceability between summarized and original data. Indexed logs and embeddings enable selective recall without re-scanning the entire history, supporting performance and scalability. In the file system, memory is exposed as /context/memory/agentID and can be extended through plugins such as vector databases or full-text search engines.

内存条目是代理特定的，并通过共享元数据和访问控制规则进行管理。每个内存项维护对其历史来源的引用，确保汇总数据与原始数据之间的可追溯性。索引日志和嵌入向量支持无需重新扫描整个历史记录即可进行选择性召回，支持性能和可扩展性。在文件系统中，内存以 /context/memory/agentID 的形式暴露，并且可以通过插件（如向量数据库或全文搜索引擎）进行扩展。

TABLE I: Taxonomy of Memory Types in Context Engineering

表 1： 上下文工程中的记忆类型分类法

| Memory Type | Temporal Scope | Structural Unit | Representation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scratchpad | Temporary, task-bounded | Dialogue turns, temporary reasoning states
对话轮次，临时推理状态 | Plain text or embeddings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Episodic Memory | Medium-term, session-bounded | Session summaries, case histories

会话摘要，案例历史 | Summaries in plain text or embeddings

纯文本或嵌入向量形式的摘要 |
| Fact Memory | Long-term, fine-grained | Atomic factual statements | Key–value pairs or triples

键值对或三元组 |
| Experiential Memory | Long-term, cross-task | Observation-action trajectories

观察-动作轨迹 | Structured logs or database |
| Procedural Memory | Long-term, system-wide | Functions, tools, or function definitions

函数、工具或函数定义 | API or code references |
| User Memory | Long-term, personalized | User attributes, preferences and histories

用户属性、偏好设置和历史记录 | User profiles, embeddings |
| Historical Record | Immutable, full-trace | Raw logs of all interactions | Plain text with metadata |

### IV-C Scratchpad: Temporary WorkspaceIV-CScratchpad: 临时工作区

Scratchpads serve as temporary workspaces where agents compose intermediate hypotheses, computations, or drafts during reasoning. Unlike memory, scratchpads are ephemeral and scoped to a specific task or reasoning episode. However, once a session concludes, relevant artefacts may be inserted into memory or appended to history, completing the loop. Scratchpads are represented in the file system as /context/pad/taskID and are governed by the same metadata and access-control schema as persistent artefacts.

临时工作区是智能体在推理过程中构建中间假设、计算或草稿的临时工作空间。与记忆不同，临时工作区是短暂的，并且限定于特定任务或推理过程。然而，一旦会话结束，相关工件可能会被插入到记忆中或追加到历史记录中，从而完成闭环。临时工作区在文件系统中以 /context/pad/taskID 形式表示，并遵循与持久化工件相同的元数据和访问控制方案。

### IV-D Governance

The lifecycle of history/memory/scratchpad is governed by explicit policies for versioning, aging, and retention. For example, obsolete scratchpads can be pruned automatically, while historical logs may be compressed but never deleted. Such policies ensure that the system remains both scalable and auditable. The persistent context repository operates as a mounted layer within the file system, using its hierarchical namespace and access-control mechanisms. It also serves as the principal data source for the context engineering pipeline, where selected memory and history artefacts are retrieved, compressed, and injected into the context constrained by the token window. All state transitions and transformations are represented as file-level events with timestamps and lineage metadata, enabling replay, audit, and reversible evolution.

历史/内存/临时存储区的生命周期由版本控制、老化和保留的明确策略管理。例如，过时的临时存储区可被自动清理，而历史日志可能会被压缩但永不删除。这些策略确保系统既具备可扩展性又可审计。持久化上下文仓库作为文件系统中的一个挂载层运行，使用其分层命名空间和访问控制机制。它还作为上下文工程流水线的主要数据源，在该流水线中，选定的内存和历史数据制品被检索、压缩，并注入到受 token 窗口约束的上下文中。所有状态转换和变换均以带有时间戳和谱系元数据的文件级事件形式表示，从而实现重放、审计和可逆演进。

## V Context Engineering PipelineV 上下文工程流水线

### V-A Design Constraints

GenAI model introduce a unique set of architectural design constraints that collectively define the rationale for the design of the context engineering pipeline, fundamentally shape how context is operated. These constraints are intrinsic to the GenAI model layer, and cascade upward through the software architecture, influencing the structure and behavior of higher-level components. Recognizing and formalizing these design constraints transforms context engineering from ad-hoc prompting practices into a systematic software-architectural discipline.

生成式 AI 模型引入了一组独特的架构设计约束，这些约束共同定义了上下文工程流程的设计原理，从根本上决定了上下文的操作方式。这些约束内在地存在于生成式 AI 模型层，并向上级联至软件架构中，影响更高层级组件的结构和行为。识别并规范这些设计约束，将上下文工程从临时的提示实践转变为系统化的软件架构学科。

#### V-A1 Token window

The token window of GenAI model introduces a hard architectural constraint, which defines the maximum number of tokens that the model can attend to during a single inference pass. This bounded reasoning capacity, determined by model architecture, sets an upper limit on the amount of active context available at runtime (e.g., 128K for GPT 5 1 1 1 https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5-chat-latest

生成式 AI 模型的 token 窗口引入了硬性架构约束，该约束定义了模型在单次推理过程中能够关注的最大 token 数量。由模型架构决定的这种有限推理能力，在运行时设置了活跃上下文数量的上限（例如，GPT 51 为 128K）。, 200k for Claude Sonnet 4.5 2 2 2 https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet). Moreover, as the length of input prompts increases, the computational cost of GenAI models rises significantly due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism \[pmlr-v201-duman-keles23a\].

此外，随着输入提示词的长度增加，GenAI 模型的计算成本因自注意力机制的二次复杂度而显著增加 \[pmlr-v201-duman-keles23a\] 。

Consequently, the context engineering pipeline must curate, compress, and incrementally stream relevant information from the file system into the model’s token window. Persistent information in memory must therefore be modularized and hierarchically organized, enabling selective retrieval and incremental refresh. The pipeline manages the temporal coherence of the active window, ensuring that reasoning remains consistent and traceable within bounded context limit. The simplest mitigation is to truncate or summarise large texts, though this inevitably risks information loss \[wang2024limitssurveytechniquesextend\].

因此，上下文工程流水线必须从文件系统中筛选、压缩并增量流式传输相关信息到模型的 token 窗口中。因此，内存中的持久化信息必须进行模块化和层次化组织，以实现选择性检索和增量刷新。该流水线管理活动窗口的时间一致性，确保推理在有限上下文范围内保持一致且可追溯。最简单的缓解方法是截断或摘要化大文本，尽管这不可避免地存在信息丢失的风险 \[wang2024limitssurveytechniquesextend\] 。

#### V-A2 Statelessness

GenAI models are inherently stateless, which do not retain conversational history or memory across sessions. This constraint requires external persistent context repository that records, reconstructs, and governs relevant information across interactions. The stateless nature also drives the need for the session memory mechanisms to restore continuity and avoid redundant computation.

生成式 AI 模型本质上是无状态的，不会在会话间保留对话历史或记忆。这一限制需要一个外部持久化上下文仓库，该仓库在交互过程中记录、重建和管理相关信息。无状态特性还促使需要会话内存机制来恢复连续性并避免冗余计算。

However, persisting state externally introduces secondary challenges related to memory growth and redundancy. As conversational or task histories accumulate, semantically similar entries or repeated experiences can increase quickly, degrading retrieval precision and increasing storage cost. To mitigate these effects, context engineering pipeline requires memory deduplication and consolidation strategies that maintain a memory base with minimal redundancy.

然而，将状态持久化到外部会带来与内存增长和冗余相关的次要挑战。随着对话或任务历史的累积，语义相似的条目或重复的经历会迅速增加，从而降低检索精度并增加存储成本。为了减轻这些影响，上下文工程流程需要内存去重和合并策略，以维持一个冗余最小的内存基础。

#### V-A3 Non-Deterministic and Probabilistic OutputV-A3 非确定性和概率性输出

Because LLMs produce probabilistic outputs conditioned on sampling parameters (e.g., temperature), identical prompts can yield varying responses. From an architectural perspective, this non-determinism introduces challenges for traceability, testing, and verification. It is required that the context engineering pipeline preserves input–output pairs, metadata, and provenance within the file system to support audit, replay, and post-hoc evaluation.

由于 LLMs 会基于采样参数（例如 temperature）生成概率性输出，相同的提示词可能会产生不同的响应。从架构角度来看，这种非确定性给可追溯性、测试和验证带来了挑战。需要确保上下文工程流程在文件系统中保留输入-输出对、元数据和溯源信息，以支持审计、重放和事后评估。

### V-B Design of Context Engineering PipelineV-B 上下文工程流水线设计

Building upon the unified architectural foundation established by the file system, this section proposes Context Engineering Pipeline that serves as the operational layer that orchestrates context evolution across components.

基于文件系统建立的统一架构基础，本节提出了 上下文工程流水线 ，它作为编排各组件间上下文演进的操作层。

A pipeline that retains context through both long-term and short-term mechanisms is a key component of an autonomous GenAI agent \[castrillo2025fundamentalsbuildingautonomousllm\]. Such a pipeline keeps the knowledge and context that is not embedded within the model’s weights. The Context Engineering Pipeline bridges context stored in the persistent context repository (history, memory, tools, human input) with bounded reasoning (the token window), ensuring that context is continuously constructed, refreshed, and evaluated throughout the operational lifecycle of an agent. Architecturally, as shown in Figure [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.05470v1#S5.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ V-B Design of Context Engineering Pipeline ‣ V Context Engineering Pipeline ‣ Everything is Context: Agentic File System Abstraction for Context Engineering"), the pipeline consists of three components: the Context Constructor, the Context Updater, and the Context Evaluator. The architecture operates under three interrelated design constraints as discussed in Section  [V-A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.05470v1#S5.SS1 "V-A Design Constraints ‣ V Context Engineering Pipeline ‣ Everything is Context: Agentic File System Abstraction for Context Engineering"). The pipeline performs selection, compression, injection, refreshing, and human-in-the-loop evaluation and overwrite, forming a closed loop for context management. Metadata in the file system is used by all the major operations in the context engineering pipeline.

一个通过长期和短期机制保留上下文的流水线是自主生成式 AI 代理的关键组件 \[castrillo2025fundamentalsbuildingautonomousllm\] 。这样的流水线会保留未嵌入模型权重中的知识和上下文。上下文工程流水线将存储在持久化上下文仓库（历史、记忆、工具、人类输入）中的上下文与有限推理（token 窗口）连接起来，确保在代理的运行生命周期中持续构建、刷新和评估上下文。从架构上看，如图 [3](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.05470v1#S5.F3 "Figure 3 ‣ V-B Design of Context Engineering Pipeline ‣ V Context Engineering Pipeline ‣ Everything is Context: Agentic File System Abstraction for Context Engineering") 所示，该流水线由三个组件组成： 上下文构造器 、 上下文更新器 和 上下文评估器 。该架构在三个相互关联的设计约束下运行，如第 [V-A](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.05470v1#S5.SS1 "V-A Design Constraints ‣ V Context Engineering Pipeline ‣ Everything is Context: Agentic File System Abstraction for Context Engineering") 节所述。流水线执行选择、压缩、注入、刷新以及人在回路中的评估和覆盖，形成上下文管理的闭环。 文件系统中的元数据被上下文工程流水线中的所有主要操作使用。

![Refer to caption](Figures/pipeline.png)

Figure 3: The Context Engineering Pipeline. 图 3： 上下文工程流程

#### V-B1 Context Constructor

The Constructor defines how relevant context is selected, prioritized, and compressed from the persistent context repository to prepare bounded, task-specific inputs for reasoning. This process transforms unbounded knowledge into a curated subset that is suitable for the model’s active context window. Context selection must also fulfill non-functional qualities such as privacy, access control, and data governance. Because the file system serves as a shared global infrastructure across agents and tasks, the Constructor enforces these constraints to ensure that each reasoning session operates within its authorized scope and the corresponding context remains properly isolated.

构造器定义了如何从持久化上下文代码仓库中选择、排序和压缩相关上下文，以准备有边界的、特定任务的推理输入。这一过程将无边界的知识转化为适合模型活动上下文窗口的精心筛选子集。上下文选择还必须满足隐私、访问控制和数据治理等非功能性要求。由于文件系统作为跨代理和任务的共享全局基础设施，构造器会实施这些约束，以确保每个推理会话在其授权范围内运行，并且相应的上下文保持适当隔离。

Architecturally, the Constructor manages a trade-off between completeness (covering all relevant information) with boundedness (respecting token constraint and cost efficiency). It relies on metadata indicating recency, provenance, which together help infer the relevance of context elements during retrieval and prioritization. Selected context is then compressed through summarization, embedding, or clustering techniques to meet computational budgets, before being aligned with the model’s prompt schema \[white2023promptpatterncatalogenhance, 10.1145/3560815\], a structured input format specifying how context elements are organized for inference.

从架构角度，构造器在完整性（涵盖所有相关信息）和有界性（遵守 token 约束与成本效率）之间进行权衡。它依赖于指示时效性和来源的元数据，这些元数据共同帮助在检索和优先级排序过程中推断上下文元素的相关性。选定的上下文随后通过摘要、嵌入或聚类技术进行压缩以满足计算预算，之后与模型的提示模式 \[white2023promptpatterncatalogenhance, 10.1145/3560815\] 对齐，该模式是一种结构化的输入格式，用于指定如何组织上下文元素以进行推理。

The Constructor interfaces directly with the file system mount points (e.g., /context/memory/, /context/tool/), queries metadata, and generates a context manifest that records which elements were selected, excluded, and why. This manifest provides transparency, reproducibility, and verifiability for each reasoning session, turning context assembly from an ad hoc operation into a traceable architectural process.

The Constructor directly interacts with the file system mount points (e.g., /context/memory/, /context/tool/), queries metadata, and generates a context manifest that records which elements were selected, excluded, and why. This manifest provides transparency, reproducibility, and verifiability for each reasoning session, turning context assembly from an ad hoc operation into a traceable architectural process.

#### V-B2 Context Updater

The Context Updater manages the transfer and refresh of constructed context into the bounded reasoning space of the GenAI model. Given the model’s limited token window, the Updater must continuously synchronize the token window, the state of the persistent context repository, and the runtime dialogue to maintain coherence and consistency. It ensures that the active context always reflects the most relevant and authorized information, without exceeding model limits or violating access and governance constraints. This synchronization requires continuous monitoring of context size, relevance decay, and temporal and structural dependencies across agents and sessions.

上下文更新器管理构建的上下文到生成式人工智能(GenAI)模型的有界推理空间中的传输和刷新。考虑到模型有限的 token 窗口，更新器必须持续同步 token 窗口、持久化上下文仓库的状态以及运行时对话，以保持连贯性和一致性。它确保活动上下文始终反映最相关和授权的信息，不超过模型限制或违反访问和治理约束。这种同步需要持续监控上下文大小、相关性衰减以及跨代理和会话的时间和结构依赖关系。

At beginning of the process, a static snapshot of context may be fed into before a single reasoning task for processing. During extended reasoning, incremental streaming allows additional fragments of context to be progressively loaded as the reasoning unfolds. In dynamic or interactive sessions, adaptive refresh mechanisms replace outdated or less relevant fragments in response to model feedback or human intervention. Together, these modes collectively ensure that the reasoning process remains contextually grounded.

在流程开始时，在单个推理任务处理之前，可能会输入上下文的静态快照。在扩展推理过程中，增量流式传输允许随着推理的展开逐步加载更多的上下文片段。在动态或交互式会话中，自适应刷新机制会响应模型反馈或人工干预，替换过时或相关性较低的片段。这些模式共同确保推理过程保持上下文相关。

All context loading and replacement actions are recorded as metadata events within the file system, including timestamps, source paths, and reasoning identifiers, to enable full traceability and replay of any reasoning session. In multi-agent scenarios, the Context Updater also enforces resource isolation and access separation, ensuring that the context of one reasoning process neither interferes with nor leaks into another.

所有上下文加载和替换操作都在文件系统中记录为元数据事件，包括时间戳、源路径和推理标识符，以实现任何推理会话的完整可追溯性和重放。在多智能体场景中，上下文更新器还实施资源隔离和访问分离，确保一个推理过程的上下文既不会干扰也不会泄露到另一个推理过程中。

#### V-B3 Context Evaluator

The Context Evaluator closes the loop by verifying model outputs, updating the persistent context repository, and maintaining governance over the evolving knowledge base. It ensures that newly generated or refined information is validated, contextualized, and reintegrated into the persistent context repository in a traceable and auditable manner.

上下文评估器通过验证模型输出、更新持久上下文仓库以及对不断发展的知识库进行治理，形成闭环。它确保新生成或优化的信息经过验证、上下文化处理，并以可追溯和可审计的方式重新整合到持久上下文仓库中。

Model outputs are evaluated against their source context element and provenance metadata to detect hallucinations, contradictions, or context drift. This may involve automated semantic comparison, factual consistency checking, or cross-referencing with authoritative sources. Evaluation metrics, such as confidence scores, factual alignment, and human override rates, are recorded as structured metadata within the file system, supporting post-hoc analysis and traceability.

模型输出根据其源上下文元素和出处元数据进行评估，以检测幻觉、矛盾或上下文漂移。这可能涉及自动化语义比较、事实一致性检查或与权威来源交叉引用。评估指标（如置信度分数、事实对齐度和人工覆盖率）被记录为文件系统中的结构化元数据，支持事后分析和可追溯性。

Verified outputs are transformed into structured memory element, updating or extending the persistent context repository. Long-term memory entries may be appended, revised, or summarized, while episodic memories and scratchpads are pruned or archived. Each update is versioned with timestamps and lineage metadata, ensuring that context evolution remains transparent and reversible.

经过验证的输出被转换为结构化记忆元素，更新或扩展持久化上下文仓库。长期记忆条目可被追加、修订或总结，而情景记忆和临时笔记则被清理或归档。每次更新均通过时间戳和谱系元数据进行版本化，确保上下文演变过程透明且可回滚。

When confidence thresholds are low or contradictions are detected, the Evaluator triggers human review. Human annotations, ranging from factual corrections to interpretive insights, are stored as explicit context elements, elevating tacit knowledge becomes a first-class component of the knowledge base.

当置信阈值较低或检测到矛盾时，评估器会触发人工审核。人工标注（从事实性修正到解释性见解不等）被存储为显式上下文元素，从而使隐性知识成为知识库中的一等组件。

## VI Implementation Platform: AIGNE FrameworkVI 实现平台：AIGNE 框架

The proposed file system and context engineering pipeline are implemented within the AIGNE Framework 3 3 3 https://github.com/AIGNE-io/aigne-framework

提出的文件系统和上下文工程流程在 AIGNE Framework3 中实现, a functional development framework designed to simplify and accelerate the creation of GenAI agents. AIGNE provides native integration with multiple mainstream large language models (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, Ollama) and external services via the built-in Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling dynamic and context-aware application behaviour.

AIGNE，一个功能开发框架，旨在简化和加速生成式人工智能代理（GenAI agents）的创建。AIGNE 通过内置的模型上下文协议（MCP），与多个主流大语言模型（如 OpenAI、Gemini、Claude、DeepSeek、Ollama）及外部服务实现原生集成，从而实现动态且上下文感知的应用行为。

In the AIGNE framework, the AFS (Agentic File System) module serves as the primary file system interface. The SystemFS module implements a virtual file system that provides the following key features.

在 AIGNE 框架中， AFS （代理文件系统）模块作为主要文件系统接口。 SystemFS 模块实现了一个虚拟文件系统，该系统提供以下关键特性。

- Supports list, read, write, and search commands for managing files within mounted directories.
 
 • 支持用于管理挂载目录内文件的列出、读取、写入和搜索命令。
- 支持跨嵌套子目录导航，深度限制可配置。
- Integrates with ripgrep for efficient content search.
 
 • 与 ripgrep 集成，实现高效的内容搜索。
- Access to file timestamps, sizes, types, and support user-defined metadata
 
 对文件时间戳、大小、类型的访问，以及支持用户自定义元数据
- Sandboxed access restricted to mounted directories, ensuring isolation and secure file operation
 
 • 沙盒化访问仅限于挂载的目录，确保隔离和安全的文件操作

All mounted resources, including MCP modules, memory stores, databases, or external APIs, are projected into the file system through programmable resolvers. These resolvers implement declarative mappings (similar to GraphQL/OpenAPI schemas) that translate internal structures into AFS nodes without requiring any change to the underlying storage format, enabling semless integration of heterogenous systems.

所有已挂载的资源（包括 MCP 模块、内存存储、数据库或外部 API）都通过可编程解析器映射到文件系统。这些解析器实现声明式映射（类似于 GraphQL/OpenAPI 模式），将内部结构转换为 AFS 节点，且无需修改底层存储格式，从而实现异构系统的无缝集成。

Within AIGNE, context elements are represented as typed resources under the AFS namespace. Modules such as SystemFS, FSMemory, and UserProfileMemory, each exposing list / read / write / search APIs through standard asynchronous methods. This abstraction enables GenAI agents to access heterogeneous data, like local files, chat histories, and structured memory entries—through a uniform interface without concern for underlying storage backends.

在 AIGNE 中，上下文元素以带类型的资源形式表示在 AFS 命名空间下。诸如 SystemFS 、 FSMemory 和 UserProfileMemory 的模块，各自通过标准异步方法暴露 list / read / write / search API。这种抽象使 GenAI 代理能够通过统一接口访问异构数据（如本地文件、聊天历史和结构化内存条目），而无需关心底层存储后端。

In AIGNE, agents perform reasoning while delegating execution to modular Functions, which are implemented as executable files (e.g., Node.js modules). Each function exports a default asynchronous function together with metadata descriptors (description, input\_schema, and output\_schema) that allow agents to discover, validate, and invoke them with structured arguments. Functions act as the tools through which agents perform concrete actions, executing code in a sandbox, or calling external APIs.

In AIGNE, 智能体 perform reasoning while delegating execution to modular 函数 , which are implemented as executable files (e.g., Node.js modules). Each function exports a default asynchronous function together with metadata descriptors ( 描述 , 输入模式 , and 输出模式 ) that allow 智能体 to discover, validate, and invoke them with structured arguments. 函数 act as the tools through which 智能体 perform concrete actions, executing code in a sandbox, or calling external APIs.

The Context Constructor is implemented as a process. When a new prompt is received, The constructor executes a series of tool calls such as afs\_list() and afs\_read(), collecting candidate artefacts (documents, history records, or profile summaries) tagged with metadata including timestamps, provenance, and access scope. The constructor then applies summarisation and token-budget estimation functions to produce a JSON-formatted manifest, which records the selected artefacts, their ordering, and their estimated contribution to the model’s prompt. This manifest is passed downstream to the Context Updater.

上下文构造器以进程形式实现。当收到新的提示时，构造器会执行一系列工具调用，例如 afs\_list() 和 afs\_read() ，收集带有元数据（包括时间戳、出处和访问范围）标签的候选工件（文档、历史记录或个人资料摘要）。随后，构造器应用摘要化和令牌预算估算函数，生成 JSON 格式的清单，该清单记录所选工件、它们的顺序以及对模型提示的估计贡献。此清单被传递到下游的上下文更新器（Context Updater）。

The Context Updater is realised as part of AIGNE’s agent workflow engine. The updater streams context fragments into the model’s input buffer during dialogue. In single-turn tasks, it performs a one-off injection of a static snapshot; in interactive sessions, it incrementally refreshes the prompt by invoking AFS read operations to replace or append elements as reasoning unfolds.

上下文更新器是作为 AIGNE 代理工作流引擎的一部分实现的。更新器在对话过程中将上下文片段流式传输到模型的输入缓冲区。在单轮任务中，它对静态快照执行一次性注入；在交互式会话中，随着推理过程的展开，它通过调用 AFS 读取操作来增量刷新提示，以替换或追加元素。

The Context Evaluator leverages AIGNE’s memory modules to persist newly generated information. After each model response, validated outputs, like summarised user preferences or extracted factual statements, are written back to AFS, stored under directories such as /context/memory/fact/. Each entry is enriched with lineage metadata (createdAt, sourceId, confidence, and revisionId) to support audit and rollback. When the Evaluator detects uncertainty (e.g., confidence below threshold or inconsistent information), it triggers a human-verification stage: annotations are appended as separate artefacts in /context/human/.

上下文评估器借助 AIGNE 的内存模块持久化新生成的信息。每次模型响应后，经过验证的输出（如总结的用户偏好或提取的事实陈述）会写回至 AFS ，并存储在诸如 /context/memory/fact/ 的目录下。每个条目都补充有谱系元数据（ createdAt 、 sourceId 、 置信度 和 revisionId ），以支持审计和回滚。当评估器检测到不确定性（例如，置信度低于阈值或信息不一致）时，会触发人工验证阶段：注释作为独立制品追加到 /context/human/ 中。

### VI-A Exemplar 1: Memory-Enabled Context ConstructionVI-A 示例 1: 记忆支持的上下文构建

AIGNE enables agents to maintain contextual coherence across multiple dialogue turns. Memory is activated declaratively during agent construction through the DefaultMemory module, which persists conversation history as retrievable context. The storage location is specified as a file path (e.g., file:./memory.sqlite3), allowing memory data to be saved and reloaded across sessions. Each dialogue round is appended to memory and automatically incorporated into subsequent reasoning, enabling long-term, stateful interaction without explicit state management.

AIGNE 使代理能够在跨多个对话轮次中保持上下文连贯性。记忆在代理构建过程中通过 DefaultMemory 模块以声明方式激活，该模块将对话历史持久化为可检索的上下文。存储位置被指定为文件路径（例如 file:./memory.sqlite3 ），允许记忆数据在会话间保存和重新加载。每个对话轮次被追加到记忆中并自动纳入后续推理过程，实现无需显式状态管理的长期有状态交互。

### VI-B Exemplar 2: MCP with GithubVI-B 示例 2: MCP 与 GitHub

The second exemplar demonstrates that any MCP (Model Context Protocol) server can be mounted as an AFS module, exposing its capabilities through a unified file system interface. Using the GitHub MCP server as a real-world case, it shows AI agents interact with GitHub as if they were simply accessing files. Once mounted, the agent can invoke all GitHub MCP tools directly, using afs\_exec on /modules/github-mcp/search\_repositories and /modules/github-mcp/list\_issues.

第二个示例演示了任何 MCP（模型上下文协议）服务器都可以挂载为 AFS 模块，并通过统一的文件系统接口暴露其功能。以 GitHub MCP 服务器作为实际案例，它展示了 AI 代理与 GitHub 交互，就像它们只是在访问文件一样。一旦挂载，代理可以直接调用所有 GitHub MCP 工具，使用 afs\_exec 在 /modules/github-mcp/search\_repositories 和 /modules/github-mcp/list\_issues 上。

## VII Conclusion and Future WorkVII 结论与未来工作

Grounded in the emerging LLM-as-Operating-System paradigm, this paper presents a file system–based abstraction for context engineering. On this foundation, agents and humans interact as OS-like processes applying standard file operations governed by metadata and transaction logs. The implementation within the AIGNE framework and accompanying exemplars demonstrate the feasibility and adaptability of the proposed approach. Treating context as files further enables GenAI agents to become traceable and auditable, allowing context to be versioned, reviewed, and deployed using DevOps and data-ops practices rather than ad hoc prompt management. By treating the file system as a universal context projection layer, the architecture provides a concrete substrate for emerging LLM-as-OS paradigms, enabling agents to navigate, organize, and evolve their own world models in a verifiable, human-aligned manner.

基于新兴的 LLM-作为操作系统 范式，本文提出了一种基于文件系统的上下文工程抽象。在此基础上，智能体和人类以类操作系统进程的方式交互，执行由元数据和事务日志管理的标准文件操作。AIGNE 框架内的实现及配套示例证明了所提方法的可行性和适应性。将上下文视为文件进一步使生成式 AI 智能体变得可追溯和可审计，允许上下文通过 DevOps 和数据运维（data-ops）实践进行版本化、审查和部署，而非临时提示管理。通过将文件系统视为通用上下文投影层，该架构为新兴的 LLM-作为操作系统范式提供了具体基础，使智能体能够以可验证、与人类目标一致的方式导航、组织和演化自身的世界模型。

Future extensions will explore agentic navigation within the AFS hierarchy, enabling agents to autonomously browse, construct indices, and evolve data structures in the mounted space. By allowing agents to function as self-organising processes that observe and modify their own context, the architecture can gradually evolve into a living knowledge fabric, where reasoning, memory, and action converge within a verifiable and extensible file system substrate. Another important direction is to strengthen human–AI co-work, empowering humans not only to oversee or correct system behaviour but also to contribute to, curate, and contextualise knowledge as active participants in context engineering.

未来的扩展将探索 AFS 层次结构内的智能体导航，使智能体能够在挂载空间中自主浏览、构建索引并演化数据结构。通过允许智能体作为能够观察和修改自身上下文的自组织过程，该架构可逐步演化为一个活的知识结构，其中推理、记忆和行动在可验证且可扩展的文件系统底层中融合。另一个重要方向是加强人机协作，赋能人类不仅能够监督或纠正系统行为，还能作为上下文工程的积极参与者，为知识贡献内容、进行整理并赋予上下文。
