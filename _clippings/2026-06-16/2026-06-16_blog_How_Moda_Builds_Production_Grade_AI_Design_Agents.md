# How Moda Builds Production-Grade AI Design Agents with Deep Agents

[Moda](https://moda.app/?ref=blog.langchain.com) 是一个面向营销人员、创始人、销售人员和小型企业主等非设计师的 AI 原生设计平台，这些用户无需设计背景即可创建专业级别的演示文稿、社交媒体帖子、宣传册和 PDF 文件。它类似 Canva 或 Figma，但配备了类似 Cursor 的 AI 侧边栏，能直接在完全可编辑的 2D 矢量画布上构建并迭代设计。

Moda 的核心是一个基于 **Deep Agents** 构建的多智能体系统，其中， **LangSmith** 提供了可观测性层，使团队能够快速迭代并自信地发布产品。

## 挑战：让 AI 擅长视觉设计

AI 代码生成效果很好，部分原因是 HTML 和 CSS 已经具备诸如 Flexbox 和 Grid 等布局抽象。你描述的是关系和相对大小，而不是像素坐标。

视觉设计没有等效的标准。最接近标准的是 PowerPoint 的 XML 规范，一种已有 40 年历史的格式，充斥着冗长、绝对的 XY 坐标，而 LLMs 在推理这些内容时臭名昭著地不擅长。使用 XML 的工具生成的设计看起来都和其他任何 AI 生成的演示文稿一样。

Moda 需要一个能够生成真正美观设计的系统，以及一个能够以生产级质量处理复杂、多轮、基于视觉任务的智能体架构。

## 代理管理工具：基于 Deep Agents 构建

Moda 的人工智能系统由三个代理组成：

1.  **设计代理：** 光标样式侧边栏背后的主要代理，负责画布上所有实时设计的创建与迭代
2.  **Research Agent:** 检索并存储来自外部来源（例如：公司网站）的结构化内容到 Moda 内部的每用户文件系统中
3.  **Brand Kit Agent:** ingests brand assets (colors, fonts, logos, brand voice) from websites, uploaded brand books, or existing slide decks, so every design feels on-brand from the start

The **Research Agent and Brand Kit Agent both run on Deep Agents**. These are the team's newest agents, which they've invested in heavily. The Design Agent runs on a custom LangGraph loop — an older implementation built before Deep Agents — and the team is actively evaluating migrating it as well.

所有三个代理共享相同的整体架构：轻量级分类步骤、主要代理循环、动态上下文加载，以及 LangSmith 中的完整追踪。

## Context Engineering: The Details That Matter

要让设计代理生成真正优质、视觉连贯且符合品牌要求（不仅仅是技术上正确）的输出，需要大量刻意的上下文工程。

Here's what Moda figured out.

### A Custom DSL Instead of Raw Scene Graph

One of the hardest parts of building a design agent is figuring out how to represent visual layouts in a way LLMs can reason about effectively. Raw canvas state is verbose, coordinate-heavy, and token-expensive — not a natural fit for how models think about structure and layout.

Moda developed a context representation layer that gives the agent a cleaner, more compact view of what's on the canvas, which reduces token cost and improves output quality. The specifics are proprietary, but the general principle is the same one that makes LLMs effective at web development: give the model layout abstractions it can reason about, rather than raw numerical coordinates.

"LLMs are not good at math. PowerPoint's XML spec has a bunch of XY coordinates — that's a fine representation of the data, but it's not a great way for an LLM to describe where it wants things to live." — Ravi Parikh, Co-Founder, Moda.app

Deep Agents and LangSmith were critical here. The team used LangSmith traces extensively to evaluate how different context representations affected agent behavior, iterating on what information to include, how to structure it, and where caching breakpoints made the biggest difference to cost and latency.

### Triage → Skills → Main Loop

Every request passes through a lightweight triage node (using fast and cheap Haiku models) before reaching the main agent. The triage node classifies the output format (slide deck, PDF, LinkedIn carousel, logo, etc.) and pre-loads the relevant **skills,** which are Markdown documents containing design best practices, format guidelines, and task-specific creative instructions.

Skills are injected as human messages, with **prompt caching breakpoints** placed after the system prompt and after the skills block. This keeps the system prompt fixed and always cached while allowing dynamic context injection per request.

The main agent can also pull in additional skills mid-loop if it determines it needs them. The triage step just front-loads the high-confidence ones to avoid an unnecessary extra turn.

The design agent runs with 12–15 core tools in context at all times. An additional ~30 tools are available on demand via a `RequestToolActivation` tool the agent can call when it recognizes a specialized need, like parsing an uploaded PowerPoint file.

Each additional tool costs 50–300 tokens in the prefix, and loading new tools breaks prompt caching. But the math works out: the vast majority of requests don't need the extra tools, so keeping context lean wins overall.

"If I just look at the data, most requests do not need any additional tools activated, and there's something really nice about only having 12 to 15 tools in context." — Ravi Parikh

### Scaling Context to Canvas Size

Not every request needs full visibility into the entire project. For smaller canvases, the agent works with a complete view of the current state. For larger projects — a 20-slide deck, for instance — Moda dynamically manages how much context the agent receives, giving it a higher-level summary and letting it pull in details as needed through tooling.

This keeps token usage bounded without sacrificing the agent's ability to make informed design decisions across complex, multi-page projects. LangSmith's cost tracking per node made it straightforward to find the right balance between context richness and efficiency.

## UX: The Cursor Moment for Design

One of Moda's most deliberate product choices is the interaction model. Rather than a generate-and-replace flow, where AI produces a static output and hands it off, Moda's AI works directly on a fully editable 2D vector canvas. Every element the agent creates is immediately selectable, movable, resizable, and styleable by the user.

This changes the relationship between user and AI from "accept or reject" to genuine collaboration. The AI generates a solid starting point and the user refines it. Neither has to do all the work.

The Cursor-style sidebar reinforces this: it's always present, always contextually aware of what's on the canvas, and designed for iterative back-and-forth rather than one-shot generation. For non-designers especially, this removes the intimidation of the blank canvas while keeping them in control of the final result.

## Observability with LangSmith

Because all three agents are traced through LangSmith, Ravi has full visibility into every execution. He keeps it open whenever he's actively developing.

Key workflows:

- **Prompt & tool iteration:** make a change, run a query, pull up the trace immediately to see exactly what the agent did and why
- **Cost tracking:** token cost broken down per node, making expensive steps easy to spot
- **Cache hit analysis:** especially important given the dynamic skill and tool loading; quickly surfaces where caching is working and where it's breaking down
- **Error diagnosis:** surfacing tool call failures and unexpected model behavior before they become user-facing issues

"If I'm iterating on the prompt, if I'm iterating on the tool set, I'm going to make a change, run a query, and then pull up that trace in LangSmith and just look at what happened... It's made us move faster." — Ravi Parikh

Moda doesn't yet run formal evals but it's on the roadmap. For now, LangSmith traces serve as the primary feedback loop for catching regressions and validating improvements.

## Results & What's Next

Moda has found strong early product-market fit with B2B companies doing enterprise sales: teams that need polished, brand-accurate pitch decks fast. The combination of the fully editable canvas and the Deep Agents-powered backend means users get a professional starting point they can actually refine, not a static output they're stuck with.

Next up: wiring up the memory primitives that are already in place, completing the Deep Agents migration for the Design Agent, and expanding the brand context system to support multi-team, multi-brand enterprise customers.
