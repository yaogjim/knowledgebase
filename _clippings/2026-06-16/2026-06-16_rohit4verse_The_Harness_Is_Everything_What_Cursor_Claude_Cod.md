# The Harness Is Everything: What Cursor, Claude Code, and Perplexity Actually Built 驾驭一切：Cursor、Claude 代码和 Perplexity 究竟打造了什么

You are not using AI wrong because you haven't found the right model.

你没有错误地使用 AI，因为你还没有找到合适的模型。

You are using AI wrong because you haven't built the right environment.

你错误地使用 AI，因为你没有构建合适的环境。

There is a reason some teams are shipping a million lines of code with three engineers while others are struggling to get a consistent refactor out of their agent pipeline. The difference is not GPT-5 versus Claude Opus. The difference is not the temperature setting or the max tokens. It isn't even the prompt, though everyone loses months of their life arguing about prompts.

有些团队仅凭借三名工程师就能交付百万行代码，而另一些团队却难以实现其智能代理管道的一致性重构，这其中是有原因的。区别不在于 GPT-5 与 Claude Opus 的对比，也不在于温度设置或最大 token 数，甚至也不在于提示词——尽管每个人都要耗费数月时间争论提示词。

The difference is the harness.

区别在于线束。

This article is about what that word actually means, technically and philosophically, because the industry has developed a bad habit of using it loosely. A harness is not a system prompt. It is not a wrapper around an API call. It is not an eval framework or a prompt template or a chatbot with memory. A harness is the complete designed environment inside which a language model operates, including the tools it can call, the format of information it receives, how its history is compressed and managed, the guardrails that catch its mistakes before they cascade, and the scaffolding that allows it to hand off work to its future self without losing coherence.

本文将从技术和哲学角度探讨“harness”这个词的实际含义，因为行业中存在随意使用该词的不良习惯。框架不是系统提示。它不是 API 调用的包装器。它不是评估框架、提示模板，也不是带记忆的聊天机器人。框架是语言模型运行的完整设计环境，包括它可以调用的工具、接收信息的格式、历史记录的压缩与管理方式、在错误蔓延前捕获错误的护栏，以及允许它将工作交接给未来的自己而不失去连贯性的支撑结构。

When you look at what Anthropic built to make Claude Code actually work, what OpenAI built to ship a million lines of code through Codex with zero manually-written code, and what the Princeton NLP group published in their landmark SWE-agent paper about agent-computer interfaces, you start to see the same pattern emerging from every serious team working in this space.

当你观察 Anthropic 为使 Claude Code 真正发挥作用所做的工作、OpenAI 通过 Codex 交付百万行代码且零手动编写代码的成果，以及普林斯顿 NLP 研究组在其里程碑式的 SWE-agent 论文中发表的关于代理-计算机接口的研究内容时，你会发现这个领域中每个认真投入的团队都呈现出同样的模式。

The model is almost irrelevant. The harness is everything.

模型几乎无关紧要。工具链才是一切。

This is a detailed technical breakdown of how that idea became the defining insight of applied AI engineering in 2025 and 2026. It covers the research, the real implementations, the failure modes that motivated the design decisions, and the patterns that repeat whether you are building a coding agent, a research agent, or a long-running autonomous software engineer. By the end, you will understand not just what a harness is, but why building one correctly is now the most valuable engineering skill in the industry.

这是对这一想法如何在 2025 年和 2026 年成为应用 AI 工程核心洞察的详细技术剖析。它涵盖了研究、实际实施、推动设计决策的失败模式，以及无论你是在构建编码代理、研究代理还是长期运行的自主软件工程师，都会重复出现的模式。最终，你不仅会理解什么是框架，还会明白为什么正确构建框架现在是行业中最有价值的工程技能。

# Part One: The Problem Nobody Talks About

第一部分：没人谈论的问题

## Why Raw Capability Is Not Enough

为什么原始能力是不够的

In mid-2024, something strange happened in AI benchmarks. Researchers started noticing that the same frontier model could produce wildly different results on identical coding tasks depending entirely on how the task was presented and what tools were made available. The model had not changed. The underlying intelligence had not changed. What changed was the interface.

2024 年年中，AI 基准测试中发生了一件奇怪的事情。研究人员开始注意到，同一个前沿模型在相同的编码任务上可能会产生截然不同的结果，而这完全取决于任务的呈现方式和可用的工具。模型本身并没有改变，其底层智能也没有改变，改变的只是界面。

This should not have been surprising. We have known for decades that the right tools make engineers dramatically more productive. A software developer with a modern IDE, debugger, version control, and CI/CD pipeline is orders of magnitude more effective than the same developer working in a raw terminal with only a text editor. The IDE does not make the developer smarter. It removes friction, surfaces information at the right moment, catches errors early, and organizes work into navigable units.

这本不该令人惊讶。我们几十年来都知道，合适的工具能显著提高工程师的生产力。拥有现代 IDE、调试器、版本控制和 CI/CD 流水线的软件开发人员，其工作效率比仅使用文本编辑器在纯终端环境下工作的同一名开发人员高出几个数量级。IDE 并不会让开发人员变得更聪明。它减少摩擦，在适当的时候呈现信息，及早发现错误，并将工作组织成可导航的单元。

Language models are the same. They are not general reasoners working from some infinite internal knowledge base. They are sophisticated pattern-matching engines that operate on tokens in a context window. Everything they know in a given moment is determined by what is in that context window, and everything they produce is conditioned on how that context is structured. The format of the input is not decoration. It is the cognitive architecture of the agent.

语言模型是相同的。它们不是从某个无限内部知识库进行推理的通用推理者。它们是在上下文窗口中的词元上运行的复杂模式匹配引擎。在特定时刻，它们所知道的一切都由上下文窗口中的内容决定，而它们生成的一切都取决于该上下文的结构方式。输入格式并非装饰，而是智能体的认知架构。

The interface is not a convenience layer. For an LM agent, the interface is the mind.

界面不是一个便利层。对于 LM 代理来说，界面就是其思维。

This is the central claim of the SWE-agent paper published by the Princeton NLP group in 2024, and it holds up under scrutiny. The paper introduced the concept of an Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) and demonstrated that a carefully designed ACI could produce a 64% relative improvement in benchmark performance compared to the same model interacting through a standard Linux shell. Same model, same task, same compute budget. The only variable was the interface.

这是普林斯顿 NLP 研究组 2024 年发表的 SWE-agent 论文的核心主张，且该主张经得起检验。该论文提出了代理-计算机接口（ACI）的概念，并证明了与通过标准 Linux Shell 交互的同一模型相比，精心设计的 ACI 可使基准性能提升 64%。同一模型、同一任务、相同计算预算，唯一的变量是接口。

Let that land for a moment. 64% is not a marginal gain. That is the difference between a tool that works and a tool that does not. And it came entirely from environment design, not from any improvement in the underlying model.

先让这一点沉淀一下。64%并不是一个微小的提升。这就是能用的工具和不能用的工具之间的区别。而且这完全来自于环境设计，而非底层模型的任何改进。

## The Context Window Is Not a RAM Slot

上下文窗口不是 RAM 插槽

The naive mental model of an AI agent treats the context window like RAM. You load data in, the model processes it, you get output. More context equals better performance. Longer prompts equal richer understanding. This mental model is wrong in ways that will ruin your agent if you build around it.

AI 智能体的天真心智模型将上下文窗口视为内存。你加载数据，模型处理数据，你得到输出。更多上下文等同于更好的性能。更长的提示等同于更丰富的理解。如果你围绕这种心智模型构建智能体，这种模型是错误的，会毁掉你的智能体。

The context window is actually closer to the agent's entire working consciousness for a given session. Every token in that window costs computation. Every irrelevant piece of information competes for attention with the relevant information. The model does not have a selective attention mechanism that cleanly ignores noise. The noise is in the room, and it affects the reasoning.

上下文窗口实际上更接近代理在特定会话中的整个工作意识。该窗口中的每个 token 都消耗计算资源。每一条无关信息都与相关信息争夺注意力。该模型没有能够干净地忽略噪声的选择性注意力机制。噪声存在于环境中，会影响推理过程。

This has specific, measurable consequences for agent design. When you run grep on a large codebase from inside an agent loop and return ten thousand lines of matches, you have not given the agent more information to work with. You have flooded its working memory with irrelevant data that will degrade the quality of every subsequent step until the context is cleared. When you dump an entire file with cat because the agent wanted to see two functions, you have handed it a firehose when it needed a drinking glass.

这对代理设计有具体且可衡量的后果。当你在代理循环中对一个大型代码库运行 grep 并返回一万行匹配结果时，你并没有给代理更多可处理的信息。你用无关数据淹没了它的工作内存，这会降低后续每一步的质量，直到上下文被清除。当你因为代理想要查看两个函数而用 cat 输出整个文件时，你给它的是一根消防水带，而它需要的只是一个水杯。

The SWE-agent researchers were meticulous about documenting these failure modes. A standard bash interface caused agents to thrash. They would issue grep commands that returned thousands of lines, lose track of what they were looking for, issue more grep commands, gradually fill up their context with noise, and eventually either produce a wrong answer or stop making progress entirely. The problem was not model intelligence. The problem was that the interface had no mechanism for protecting the agent from itself.

SWE-agent 研究人员在记录这些故障模式时非常细致。标准 bash 界面导致代理陷入混乱。他们会执行返回数千行结果的 grep 命令，失去对目标的追踪，执行更多 grep 命令，逐渐用噪声信息填满其上下文，最终要么给出错误答案，要么完全停滞不前。问题不在于模型智能，而在于该界面缺乏保护代理自身的机制。

The ACI solution was to build a search tool that returned a capped, summarized list of results. If your search returned more than 50 matches, the tool would suppress the output and tell the agent to narrow its query. This single design decision, which looks almost insultingly simple in retrospect, was one of the highest-leverage changes in the entire paper. It transformed a context-flooding failure mode into a natural refinement loop.

ACI 解决方案是构建一个搜索工具，该工具返回一个有上限的汇总结果列表。如果搜索结果超过 50 个匹配项，该工具会抑制输出，并告知代理缩小其查询范围。这一单一设计决策，回顾起来看似简单得近乎令人冒犯，却是整篇论文中最具影响力的改动之一。它将一种上下文泛滥的失败模式转变为一个自然的优化循环。

# Part Two: The SWE-Agent Paper and the Birth of the ACI

第二部分：SWE-Agent 论文与 ACI 的诞生

## What an Agent-Computer Interface Actually Is

代理-计算机接口实际上是什么

The ACI is defined in the SWE-agent paper as an abstraction layer situated between a language model agent and a computer environment. The analogy to a human-computer interface (HCI) is intentional. Just as HCI research asks how to design interfaces that match human cognitive architecture, ACI research asks how to design interfaces that match LM cognitive architecture.

ACI 在 SWE-agent 论文中被定义为位于语言模型代理和计算机环境之间的抽象层。与人机界面（HCI）的类比是有意为之的。正如人机界面研究关注如何设计匹配人类认知架构的界面，ACI 研究关注如何设计匹配语言模型认知架构的界面。

Human cognitive architecture involves visual pattern recognition, spatial memory, parallel attention across a screen, and the ability to skim and selectively focus. LM cognitive architecture is fundamentally different. It involves sequential token processing, sensitivity to context order and formatting, limited working memory, and a tendency to anchor on whatever information appears most prominently in the prompt. Designing a good ACI means understanding these constraints and building around them, not against them.

人类认知架构包括视觉模式识别、空间记忆、屏幕上的并行注意力，以及略读和选择性聚焦的能力。语言模型认知架构则根本不同。它涉及顺序的标记处理、对上下文顺序和格式的敏感性、有限的工作记忆，以及倾向于锚定提示词中最突出的信息。设计良好的 AI 认知界面意味着理解这些约束并围绕它们构建，而非与之对抗。

The SWE-agent ACI for coding tasks had four main components, and each one reflects a specific insight about how language models fail when given raw computer access.

Search and Navigation

搜索和导航

The search component replaced standard grep and find commands with purpose-built tools: find\_file, search\_file, and search\_dir. The key difference was not syntax. The key difference was output management. Results were capped at 50. If a query exceeded that limit, the tool returned a message explaining that there were too many results and prompting the agent to refine its search. This sounds trivial. In practice, it was one of the most consequential decisions in the paper.

搜索组件用专门构建的工具（find\_file、search\_file 和 search\_dir）替代了标准的 grep 和 find 命令。关键区别不在于语法，而在于输出管理。结果限制在 50 条。如果查询超过该限制，工具会返回一条消息，说明结果过多，并提示代理优化搜索。这听起来很琐碎，但实际上，这是本文中最关键的决策之一。

The reason it matters is that agents, like humans under cognitive load, tend to keep doing what they are doing when they feel uncertain. When a human is lost in a large codebase, they search more and more broadly, generating more and more noise. The capped search tool interrupted this pattern by creating a forcing function. You cannot proceed by being vague. You must be specific. This pushed the agent toward more deliberate, targeted behavior.

重要的原因在于，智能体（agent）就像处于认知负荷状态下的人类一样，在感到不确定时往往会持续重复当前的行为。当人类在大型代码库中迷失方向时，他们会进行越来越广泛的搜索，产生越来越多的噪音。受限搜索工具通过引入强制函数打破了这种模式：你不能模糊行事，必须具体明确。这促使智能体转向更刻意、更具针对性的行为。

The File Viewer

文件查看器

The file viewer is where the paper's insights about cognitive architecture get most concrete. The researchers tested multiple viewer configurations and found that showing 100 lines at a time was a Goldilocks number. Fewer lines (they tested 30) caused agents to lose context about the surrounding code and make editing mistakes. More lines (or the full file) caused agents to lose track of where they were and miss important details.

文件查看器是论文中关于认知架构的见解最为具体的地方。研究人员测试了多种查看器配置，发现每次显示100行是一个恰到好处的行数。更少的行数（他们测试了30行）会导致用户失去对周围代码的上下文感知，并产生编辑错误。更多的行数（或者整个文件）会导致用户迷失位置，错过重要细节。

The viewer was stateful. It maintained a position in the file across interactions. And critically, it prepended explicit line numbers to every visible line. This last detail sounds cosmetic. It was not. When an agent needs to issue an edit command targeting lines 47 through 52, it needs to be able to read those numbers directly from the view rather than counting them or performing arithmetic. Removing that cognitive task from the agent's working memory freed up capacity for the actual problem-solving.

该查看器是有状态的。它在交互过程中保持文件中的位置。并且关键的是，它在每一行可见行的前面添加了明确的行号。这个细节听起来像是装饰性的，但事实并非如此。当代理需要发出针对第47行到第52行的编辑命令时，它需要能够直接从视图中读取这些数字，而不是自己计数或进行计算。消除代理工作记忆中的这个认知任务，为实际解决问题腾出了能力空间。

The File Editor With Linting

带代码检查的文件编辑器

The file editor's key innovation was immediate feedback with guardrails. The edit command accepted a start line, end line, and replacement text as a single operation. After every edit, the tool automatically ran a linter on the modified file and reported the result. If the edit introduced a syntax error, the edit was rejected before it was applied, and the agent received a clear error message showing both the original code and the failed edit.

文件编辑器的核心创新点是带有防护机制的即时反馈。编辑命令接受起始行、结束行和替换文本作为单一操作。每次编辑后，该工具会自动在修改后的文件上运行代码检查器并报告结果。如果编辑引入了语法错误，编辑会在应用前被拒绝，并且代理会收到一条清晰的错误消息，显示原始代码和失败的编辑内容。

This closed the feedback loop that causes cascading failures in naive agent implementations. Without a linter, an agent can introduce a syntax error, run the test suite, see a failure that seems unrelated (because the real error is elsewhere), spend multiple steps chasing the wrong problem, and eventually exhaust its context window chasing a ghost. With the linter integrated directly into the editor, syntax errors are caught at the moment of introduction, and the fix is localized before the problem can propagate.

这关闭了导致简单代理实现中发生级联故障的反馈循环。没有 linter 时，代理可能会引入语法错误，运行测试套件，看到看似无关的失败（因为真正的错误在别处），花费多个步骤追查错误的问题，最终在追逐幻影的过程中耗尽其上下文窗口。将 linter 直接集成到编辑器中后，语法错误会在引入时就被捕获，并且在问题传播之前就能定位并修复。

Compare this to what happens when an agent uses raw bash tools. With sed or output redirection, there is no integrated feedback. Edits execute silently. Multi-line changes require complex argument formatting that is highly prone to mistakes. The agent might successfully run the command and introduce a subtle formatting error that the linter would have caught, and then spend the next ten steps wondering why the tests are failing.

将此与代理使用原始 bash 工具时的情况进行比较。使用 sed 或输出重定向时，不存在集成反馈。编辑操作会静默执行。多行修改需要复杂的参数格式设置，而这极易出错。代理可能会成功运行命令，但引入了一个 linter 本可以捕获的不易察觉的格式错误，然后在接下来的十个步骤中一直疑惑为什么测试失败。

Context Management

上下文管理

The fourth component addressed a problem that compounds over long sessions: the accumulation of stale context. As an agent works through a task, its history fills up with old observations, intermediate states, and exploratory steps that no longer reflect the current state of the environment. All of that history takes up space in the context window and can actively mislead the agent by providing outdated information.

第四个组件解决了一个会在长时间会话中加剧的问题：过时上下文的累积。当代理执行任务时，其历史记录会被旧观察、中间状态和探索步骤填满，这些内容不再反映环境的当前状态。所有这些历史记录都会占用上下文窗口中的空间，并可能通过提供过时信息主动误导代理。

The ACI's context management system collapsed older observations, those beyond the last five turns, into single-line summaries. This kept the active context focused on recent, relevant information while preserving a compressed record of the overall trajectory. The agent could always see what it had recently done and what the current state was, without being buried in the full uncompressed history of every command it had ever run.

ACI 的上下文管理系统将较早的观察结果（即超出最近五个回合的观察）合并为单行摘要。这使得活跃上下文聚焦于近期、相关的信息，同时保留了整体轨迹的压缩记录。智能体始终能够查看其最近执行的操作和当前状态，而不会被其曾经执行过的每一条指令的完整未压缩历史所淹没。

## The Benchmark Results and What They Actually Mean

基准测试结果及其实际含义

The SWE-agent paper benchmarked its ACI against the SWE-bench dataset, a collection of real GitHub issues from popular Python repositories. The task is to take a natural language bug report and produce a code patch that resolves it. This is a hard, practical task that requires navigating unfamiliar codebases, understanding error messages, writing correct code, and verifying the fix.

SWE-agent 论文将其 ACI 与 SWE-bench 数据集进行了基准测试，该数据集是来自流行的 Python 仓库的真实 GitHub 问题集合。该任务是接收一份自然语言的 bug 报告，并生成一个能够修复该问题的代码补丁。这是一项困难且实际的任务，需要浏览不熟悉的代码库、理解错误消息、编写正确的代码以及验证修复。

Using GPT-4 with a standard bash shell interface, the system resolved 3.97% of issues. Using GPT-4 with the purpose-built ACI, the system resolved 12.47% of issues. That is the 64% relative improvement mentioned earlier, and it came entirely from interface design.

使用标准的 bash Shell 界面时，系统解决了 3.97% 的问题。使用 GPT-4 配合专门构建的 ACI 时，系统解决了 12.47% 的问题。这就是前面提到的 64% 的相对改进，而这一改进完全来自界面设计。

The researchers also ran ablation studies, removing one component at a time to isolate the contribution of each design decision. The linter integration was consistently among the highest-leverage components. The capped search was critical for preventing context flooding. The stateful file viewer with line numbers meaningfully outperformed both the raw cat command and simpler viewer designs.

研究人员还进行了消融实验，一次移除一个组件以隔离每个设计决策的贡献。linter 集成始终是最高杠杆组件之一。受限搜索对防止上下文泛滥至关重要。带行号的有状态文件查看器显著优于原始 cat 命令和更简单的查看器设计。

The performance difference was not about model intelligence. It was about cognitive load management. The ACI reduced the work the model had to do to track state, making room for the work that actually mattered.

性能差异并不关乎模型智能。而是关乎认知负荷管理。ACI 减少了模型为跟踪状态而必须执行的工作，为真正重要的工作腾出了空间。

The implications extend well beyond coding agents. Any long-horizon agent task involves the same fundamental challenges: navigating large information spaces, maintaining coherent state across many steps, catching and recovering from errors, and managing the limited resource of context window attention. The ACI design principles generalize. The specific tools change. The underlying architecture of the problem does not.

其影响远远超出编码智能体的范畴。任何长视距智能体任务都涉及相同的基本挑战：在大型信息空间中导航、在多个步骤中保持连贯状态、发现并从错误中恢复，以及管理上下文窗口注意力的有限资源。ACI 设计原则具有通用性。具体工具会变化。问题的底层架构不会变化。

# Part Three: Anthropic's Harness Engineering (The Long-Running Agent Problem)

第三部分：Anthropic 的驾驭工程（长期运行的智能体问题）

## Why the Context Window Boundary Is the Hard Problem

为什么上下文窗口边界是难题

The SWE-agent paper addressed how to design the interface for a single agent session. Anthropic's engineering team, working on the Claude Agent SDK and Claude Code, encountered a different problem: what happens when a task is too large to complete in a single context window?

SWE-agent 论文讨论了如何为单个代理会话设计界面。Anthropic 的工程团队在开发 Claude Agent SDK 和 Claude Code 时，遇到了一个不同的问题：当一个任务太大而无法在单个上下文窗口中完成时会发生什么？

This is not a niche edge case. Most real software projects are too large to fit in any context window. A production web application has hundreds of files, thousands of functions, a test suite, configuration, documentation, and dependencies. Even with a 200K token context window, you cannot hold the full project in mind simultaneously. Human engineers solve this through external memory, documentation, version control, and the accumulated understanding that builds over weeks and months of working in a codebase. An agent starting a fresh session has none of that.

这不是一个小众的边缘案例。大多数真实的软件项目都太大，无法放入任何上下文窗口中。一个生产环境的 Web 应用包含数百个文件、数千个函数、测试套件、配置、文档和依赖项。即使有 20 万 token 的上下文窗口，你也无法同时在脑海中容纳整个项目。人类工程师通过外部记忆、文档、版本控制以及在代码库中工作数周和数月后积累的理解来解决这个问题。一个刚开始会话的智能体没有这些。

The naive solution is compaction, and it works to a point. The Claude Agent SDK includes compaction capabilities that summarize old context when the window fills up. But compaction is not enough on its own. Anthropic's internal experiments showed that even with compaction, a frontier coding model like Opus 4.5 running in a loop across multiple context windows would consistently fail to build a production-quality web app from a high-level prompt.

简单的解决方案是压缩，它在一定程度上有效。Claude Agent SDK 包含压缩能力，当上下文窗口填满时会总结旧上下文。但仅靠压缩是不够的。Anthropic 的内部实验表明，即使使用压缩，像 Opus 4.5 这样的前沿编码模型在多个上下文窗口中循环运行时，也始终无法从高级别提示中构建出生产级别的 Web 应用。

The failures clustered around two patterns, and both of them are instructive.

故障集中在两种模式上，这两种模式都具有启发性。

The first failure pattern was attempting to do too much at once. When given a prompt like "build a clone of

[claude.ai](//claude.ai)," the agent would try to one-shot the entire application. It would begin implementing feature after feature without completing or testing any of them, run out of context window in the middle of implementation, and leave the next session to start with a half-implemented application, no documentation of what had been done, and no clear indication of what state the code was in. The next agent instance would spend most of its context budget trying to understand the mess rather than making progress.

第一种失败模式是试图同时做太多事情。当收到一个提示，例如“构建一个克隆的

[claude.ai](//claude.ai)

,”的智能体就会试图一次性完成整个应用程序。它会开始逐个实现功能，而不完成或测试任何一个功能，在实现过程中耗尽上下文窗口，然后留下下一个会话，以一个未完成的应用程序开始，没有任何已完成工作的文档，也没有明确表明代码的状态。下一个智能体实例会将大部分上下文预算用于试图理解这个混乱的局面，而不是取得进展。

The second failure pattern appeared later in projects. After some features had been built, a subsequent agent instance would look around, see that progress had been made, and conclude that the job was done. It would declare victory on a partially-completed application and stop working. This is not stupidity. It is a reasonable inference from incomplete information. The agent had no structured way to know what "done" actually meant for this project.

第二种失败模式在项目中出现得较晚。在一些功能被构建完成后，后续的代理实例会四处查看，发现已经取得了进展，便得出任务已完成的结论。它会在一个部分完成的应用程序上宣告胜利并停止工作。这并非愚蠢。这是基于不完整信息的合理推断。该代理没有结构化的方式来了解“完成”对于这个项目实际意味着什么。

Both failures share a root cause: the agent had no persistent, structured understanding of the project's state that could survive the context window boundary and orient future sessions.

这两个失败有一个共同的根本原因：该代理对项目状态缺乏持续的、结构化的理解，而这种理解无法跨越上下文窗口边界，也无法为未来的会话提供方向。

## The Two-Agent Architecture: Initializer and Coding Agent

双代理架构：初始化器与编码代理

Anthropic's solution was a two-part architecture that has since become a template for how serious teams approach long-running agentic work.

Anthropic 的解决方案是一个两部分架构，此后成为了专业团队如何处理长期自主代理工作的模板。

The first part is an initializer agent. This is a specialized first session with a distinct system prompt whose entire purpose is to set up the environment that all future coding agents will operate in. It does not write features. It creates the scaffolding that makes feature development possible across many subsequent sessions.

第一部分是一个初始化代理。这是一个具有独特系统提示的专门化第一会话，其全部目的是搭建所有未来编码代理将运行的环境。它不编写功能，而是创建框架，使功能开发在许多后续会话中成为可能。

The initializer agent produces three key outputs. First, it creates an

[init.sh](//init.sh) script that can reliably start the development environment. This sounds mundane, but it has significant leverage. Every coding agent session that follows can begin by running

[init.sh](//init.sh)

rather than spending tokens figuring out how to start the servers, set up the database, and get the application into a testable state. Saving that overhead in every session accumulates.

初始化代理会产生三个关键输出。首先，它会创建一个

[init.sh](//init.sh)

脚本，该脚本可以可靠地启动开发环境。这听起来很普通，但它具有显著的优势。每个编码代理会话都可以通过运行

[init.sh](//init.sh)

而不必消耗 token 去弄清楚如何启动服务器、设置数据库以及将应用程序置于可测试状态。在每个会话中节省的这些开销会累积起来。

Second, the initializer creates a comprehensive feature list file. In the

[claude.ai](//claude.ai) clone experiment Anthropic ran internally, this meant over 200 specific, end-to-end feature descriptions, things like "a user can open a new chat, type in a query, press enter, and see an AI response." Every feature was initially marked as failing. This file serves as the project's ground truth. A coding agent starting a new session reads this file and immediately knows, with certainty, what has been built and what has not. It cannot look around, see some code, and conclude the job is done. The feature list tells it the truth.

第二，初始化器创建一个全面的功能列表文件。在

[claude.ai](//claude.ai)

内部运行的 Anthropic 克隆实验中，这意味着超过 200 个具体的端到端功能描述，例如“用户可以打开新聊天，输入查询，按回车键，然后看到 AI 响应”。每个功能最初都被标记为失败。该文件作为项目的基准事实。启动新会话的编码代理读取该文件，并立即确切地知道已构建和未构建的内容。它不能四处查看，看到一些代码就得出工作完成的结论。功能列表会告诉它真相。

Third, the initializer creates a claude-progress.txt file and makes an initial git commit. The progress file is a human-readable log that agents update at the end of every session, documenting what they worked on, what they completed, and what state they left things in. Combined with git history, this gives every future coding agent a fast way to orient itself without burning through its context budget on archaeology.

The second part is the coding agent. Every session after initialization uses a different prompt: work on one feature at a time, leave the environment in a clean state, and update the progress file and git history before the session ends. Incremental progress, documented state, clean handoffs.

第二部分是编码代理。每次会话在初始化之后都会使用不同的提示：一次处理一个功能，将环境保持为干净状态，并在会话结束前更新进度文件和 Git 历史。增量进度、有记录的状态、干净的交接。

## The Feature List as a Cognitive Anchor

功能列表作为认知锚点

The feature list deserves special attention because it solves a problem that is easy to underestimate. Without it, an agent operating in a complex codebase must infer project completeness from the code itself. This inference is unreliable. Code can exist that is not functional. Functionality can exist that is incomplete. An agent that reads the code and reasons about what is done will get the wrong answer often enough to be a serious problem.

功能列表值得特别关注，因为它解决了一个容易被低估的问题。如果没有它，在复杂代码库中运行的代理必须从代码本身推断项目的完整性。这种推断是不可靠的。可能存在不具备功能性的代码，也可能存在不完整的功能。读取代码并推理已完成内容的代理会经常得出错误的结论，这会成为一个严重的问题。

The feature list makes completeness explicit and unambiguous. Each feature has a passes field that is either true or false. An agent either updates this field after verifying a feature works end-to-end, or it does not. There is no ambiguity. There is no inference required. The ground truth lives in the file.

功能列表明确且无歧义地体现了完整性。每个功能都有一个 passes 字段，该字段的值要么为 true，要么为 false。代理要么在验证功能端到端工作正常后更新该字段，要么不更新。不存在歧义，也不需要推断。基准事实存储在文件中。

Anthropic made a deliberate decision to store this list as JSON rather than Markdown. The reason is behavioral. Empirically, models are less likely to inappropriately modify or overwrite JSON files compared to Markdown files. JSON has a rigid structure that resists casual editing. This is a small detail with real consequences: you want the feature list to be something agents update carefully, not something they casually rewrite when they feel like it.

Anthropic 刻意决定将此列表存储为 JSON 格式而非 Markdown 格式。原因是行为层面的。根据经验，与 Markdown 文件相比，模型不太可能不恰当地修改或覆盖 JSON 文件。JSON 具有严格的结构，不易被随意编辑。这是一个细节，但后果真实存在：你希望功能列表是代理会仔细更新的内容，而不是代理在想改的时候随意重写的东西。

{ "category": "functional", "description": "New chat button creates a fresh conversation", "steps": \[ "Navigate to main interface", "Click the 'New Chat' button", "Verify a new conversation is created", "Check that chat area shows welcome state", "Verify conversation appears in sidebar" \], "passes": false }

{ "category": "功能", "description": "新聊天按钮创建新对话", "steps": \[ "导航到主界面", "点击“新聊天”按钮", "验证已创建新对话", "检查聊天区域显示欢迎状态", "验证对话出现在侧边栏" \], "passes": false }

The instruction accompanying this format was explicit: it is unacceptable to remove or edit tests because this could lead to missing or buggy functionality. You prompt the model to treat this file as inviolable. The JSON structure reinforces that instruction architecturally.

附带此格式的说明明确指出：不允许删除或编辑测试（内容），因为这可能导致功能缺失或出现程序错误。你提示模型将此文件视为不可侵犯的。JSON 结构从架构上强化了该说明。

## Incremental Progress and the Clean State Requirement

增量进展与清洁状态要求

One of the hardest problems in multi-session agentic work is ensuring that each session ends in a state that the next session can safely build on. Without explicit enforcement, agents tend to leave work in whatever state they happen to be in when the context window fills up. Half-implemented features, broken tests, undocumented changes. The next agent inherits the mess.

多会话代理工作中最困难的问题之一，是确保每个会话都以一种下一会话能够安全地基于该状态进行构建的状态结束。如果没有明确的约束，代理往往会在上下文窗口填满时，将工作留在他们所处的任何状态中。未完成的功能、失效的测试、未记录的变更。下一个代理会继承这一团糟。

Anthropic's solution was to make clean state a first-class requirement rather than a nice-to-have. Every coding agent session ended with a git commit (with a descriptive message), an update to the progress file, and a reversion to a working state if needed. By "clean state" they meant code that would be appropriate for merging to a main branch: no major bugs, well-documented, in a state where a developer could reasonably begin a new feature without first untangling someone else's half-finished work.

Anthropic 的解决方案是将“干净状态”设为一等要求，而非可有可无的选项。每个编码代理会话结束时，都会进行一次 git commit（附带描述性消息）、更新进度文件，并在需要时恢复到工作状态。他们所说的“干净状态”是指适合合并到主分支的代码：无重大错误、有完善的文档，且开发者无需先理清他人未完成的工作，即可合理地开始新功能开发。

The git commit was not just a checkpoint. It was a recovery mechanism. When an agent made a change that broke something, it could use git to revert to the last known-good state and try again. This is how human engineers work, and it turns out to be exactly the right discipline for agents too. Version control is cognitive scaffolding, not just source management.

Git 提交不只是一个检查点，它还是一种恢复机制。当一个智能体进行的修改导致某些功能失效时，它可以使用 Git 回滚到最后已知的良好状态并重新尝试。这正是人类工程师的工作方式，而事实证明这对智能体来说也是完全合适的规范。版本控制是认知脚手架，而不仅仅是源代码管理。

## Testing: The Failure Mode Nobody Likes to Talk About

测试：没人喜欢谈论的失效模式

Anthropic documented a failure mode that shows up in virtually every serious agentic coding project: agents marking features as complete without properly verifying them end-to-end. An agent would make a code change, run a unit test or a curl command against the development server, see a passing result, and mark the feature as done. But the feature would not actually work when tested through the browser as a user would.

Anthropic 记录了一种故障模式，这种模式几乎出现在所有严肃的代理式编码项目中：代理会将功能标记为已完成，但未对其进行适当的端到端验证。代理会进行代码修改，对开发服务器运行单元测试或 curl 命令，看到通过的结果后就将功能标记为已完成。然而，当通过浏览器像用户一样测试时，该功能实际上无法正常工作。

The gap between unit test success and end-to-end functionality is something human engineers navigate by shifting contexts, by running the application and trying to use it. An agent without explicit browser testing capabilities has no way to perform this shift. It can only observe what its tools allow it to observe, and if those tools do not include browser automation, it will consistently miss a category of bugs that only manifest in real user flows.

单元测试成功与端到端功能之间的差距，是人类工程师通过切换上下文、运行应用程序并尝试使用它来应对的。缺乏明确浏览器测试能力的智能体无法进行这种切换。它只能观察其工具允许它观察的内容，如果这些工具不包含浏览器自动化功能，它将持续错过一类仅在真实用户流程中显现的缺陷。

The solution was to give agents access to the Puppeteer MCP server, a browser automation tool that allowed Claude to actually navigate the application, click buttons, fill forms, and verify that features worked end-to-end. The performance improvement was dramatic. Bugs that were invisible from the code alone became obvious when the agent could see what a user would see.

解决方案是让代理能够访问 Puppeteer MCP 服务器，这是一个浏览器自动化工具，它使 Claude 能够实际浏览应用程序、点击按钮、填写表单，并验证功能是否端到端正常工作。性能提升非常显著。仅从代码中无法发现的错误，当代理能够看到用户所看到的内容时就变得明显了。

This is a concrete illustration of a general principle: the quality of an agent's work is bounded by the quality of its feedback loops. If your agent cannot observe the consequences of its actions in the domain that matters, it will optimize for proxy metrics that may not correlate with actual correctness.

这是一个一般原理的具体说明：智能体工作的质量受其反馈循环质量的限制。如果你的智能体无法在关键领域观察到其行为的后果，它将优化代理指标，而这些指标可能与实际正确性不相关。

## The Startup Sequence: Getting Up to Speed Fast

启动序列：快速上手

Every coding agent session in Anthropic's harness began with a standardized startup sequence designed to orient the agent as quickly as possible without burning tokens unnecessarily. The sequence was:

在 Anthropic 的测试环境中，每个编码代理会话都始于一个标准化的启动序列，该序列旨在尽快引导代理，同时避免不必要地消耗 token。

Run pwd to confirm the working directory. Read the progress file and git log to understand recent work. Read the feature list and choose the highest-priority incomplete feature. Run the

[init.sh](//init.sh) script to start the development environment. Run the basic end-to-end test to verify the application was in a working state.

运行 pwd 命令以确认工作目录。读取进度文件和 git log 以了解近期工作。阅读功能列表并选择优先级最高的未完成功能。运行

[init.sh](//init.sh)

脚本以启动开发环境。运行基本的端到端测试以验证应用程序处于工作状态。

Only after completing all of these steps would the agent begin working on a new feature. If the startup test revealed that the application was broken, the agent would fix the existing breakage before touching anything new. This prevented the compounding problem where an agent starts a new feature on top of a broken foundation, making the underlying problem harder to isolate and fix.

只有在完成所有这些步骤之后，代理才会开始着手新功能的开发。如果启动测试发现应用程序出现故障，代理会先修复现有的故障，然后再处理任何新内容。这避免了一种叠加问题：即代理在损坏的基础上启动新功能，这会使得底层问题更难隔离和修复。

The startup sequence also saved tokens in a specific way. Because the

[init.sh](//init.sh) script documented exactly how to start the development environment, the agent did not need to figure it out from scratch. The tokens saved on environment setup in every session accumulate significantly over a long project.

启动序列还以特定方式保存了令牌。由于

[init.sh](//init.sh)

脚本准确记录了如何启动开发环境，因此代理无需从头摸索。每个会话中环境设置时保存的令牌在长期项目中会大量累积。

\[Assistant\] I'll start by getting my bearings and understanding the current state of the project. \[Tool Use\] <bash - pwd> \[Tool Use\] <read - claude-progress.txt> \[Tool Use\] <read - feature\_list.json> \[Assistant\] Let me check the git log to see recent work. \[Tool Use\] <bash - git log --oneline -20> \[Assistant\] Now let me check if there's an

[init.sh](//init.sh) script to restart the servers. <Starts the development server> \[Assistant\] Excellent! Now let me navigate to the application and verify that some fundamental features are still working. <Tests basic functionality>

\[Assistant\] 我将先了解情况并理解项目的当前状态。\[工具使用\] <bash - pwd> \[工具使用\] <read - claude-progress.txt> \[工具使用\] <read - feature\_list.json> \[Assistant\] 让我查看 git 日志以了解最近的工作。\[工具使用\] <bash - git log --oneline -20> \[Assistant\] 现在让我检查是否有一个

[init.sh](//init.sh)

脚本用于重启服务器。<Starts the development server> \[Assistant\] 太棒了！现在让我导航到应用程序并验证一些基本功能是否仍然正常工作。<Tests basic functionality>

# Part Four: OpenAI's Harness Engineering (Zero Lines of Manual Code)

第四部分：OpenAI 的 Harness 工程（零行手动代码）

## The Experiment

实验

In late August 2025, OpenAI's Codex team started a git repository with a single constraint: no human-written code. Every line of code in the repository, including application logic, tests, CI configuration, documentation, observability tooling, and internal developer utilities, would be written by Codex agents. Humans would steer. Agents would execute.

2025 年 8 月底，OpenAI 的 Codex 团队启动了一个 git 代码仓库，有一个单一的约束：没有人类编写的代码。代码仓库中的每一行代码，包括应用逻辑、测试、CI 配置、文档、可观测性工具以及内部开发者工具，都将由 Codex 代理编写。人类负责引导，代理负责执行。

Five months later, the repository contained approximately one million lines of code across all of those categories. Roughly 1,500 pull requests had been opened and merged. A small team of three engineers had driven most of this, averaging 3.5 pull requests per engineer per day. As the team grew to seven engineers, the per-engineer throughput actually increased. The product had hundreds of daily internal users and external alpha testers.

五个月后，这个代码仓库涵盖了所有这些类别，总共有约一百万行代码。约 1500 个拉取请求已被打开并合并。一个由三名工程师组成的小团队主导了大部分工作，平均每位工程师每天提交 3.5 个拉取请求。随着团队规模扩大到七名工程师，每位工程师的工作效率实际上有所提高。该产品每天有数百名内部用户和外部 alpha 测试人员。

This is not a demo. It is a real internal product built and shipped entirely through agent-generated code. The team wrote the article describing this experience in February 2026, and the central message is the same as the SWE-agent paper: the bottleneck was never model capability. The bottleneck was always environment design.

这不是一个演示。它是一个真正的内部产品，完全通过代理生成的代码构建和发布。该团队在 2026 年 2 月撰写了描述这段经历的文章，核心信息与 SWE-agent 论文一致：瓶颈从来不是模型能力，而是始终是环境设计。

## The Redefining of Engineering Work

工程工作的重新定义

The most important observation in OpenAI's harness engineering article is about how the engineering job itself changed. When your primary job is no longer to write code, what are you doing instead?

OpenAI 的工程管理文章中最重要的观察是关于工程工作本身如何发生了变化。当你的主要工作不再是编写代码时，你在做什么取而代之呢？

You are designing environments. You are specifying intent. You are building feedback loops. You are asking, constantly, not "how do I fix this bug?" but "what capability is missing from the environment that is causing this bug to appear?"

你在设计环境。你在明确意图。你在构建反馈循环。你在不断地提问，不是“我该如何修复这个 bug？”，而是“环境中缺少了什么能力导致这个 bug 出现？”

When something failed, the fix was almost never "try harder." It was almost always "what structural piece of the environment is missing or misconfigured that is causing the agent to fail here?" This is a profound shift in engineering thinking. You stop debugging code. You start debugging the system that produces code.

当出现故障时，解决方案几乎从来都不是“再努力试试”。几乎总是“环境中哪个结构性组件缺失或配置错误，导致此处代理失败？”这是工程思维的深刻转变。你不再调试代码，而是开始调试生成代码的系统。

The primary job of the engineering team became enabling the agents to do useful work, not doing the work themselves.

工程团队的主要工作变成了使代理能够做有用的工作，而不是自己做这些工作。

In practice, this meant decomposing large goals into smaller building blocks, building the tools and abstractions that make those building blocks achievable, and using failures as signals about what the environment needed to better support. The human engineers worked depth-first: when an agent got stuck, they did not try to write the code themselves. They asked what was missing, built it into the environment, and let the agent try again.

在实践中，这意味着将大目标分解为更小的构建块，构建实现这些构建块的工具和抽象概念，并将失败作为信号，表明环境需要更好地支持哪些方面。人类工程师采用深度优先的方式工作：当代理陷入困境时，他们不会尝试自己编写代码，而是询问缺少什么，将其构建到环境中，然后让代理再次尝试。

## Repository Knowledge as the System of Record

代码仓库知识作为事实来源系统

One of the most important architectural decisions in OpenAI's harness was making the repository itself the source of truth for everything an agent needed to know. The insight was simple but far-reaching: from an agent's perspective, anything it cannot access in context while running effectively does not exist. Knowledge that lives in Google Docs, Slack threads, or people's heads is invisible to the system.

OpenAI 框架中最重要的架构决策之一是将代码仓库本身作为智能体所需了解的一切信息的单一事实来源。这一洞察简单却影响深远：从智能体的角度来看，在有效运行期间无法在上下文中访问的任何事物都不存在。存储在谷歌文档、Slack 对话线程或人们脑海中的知识，系统是无法感知的。

Early in the project, the team tried the "one big AGENTS.md" approach. A single large instruction file containing everything the agent needed to know about the project, the architecture, the conventions, the constraints. It failed predictably, in four ways that are worth understanding.

在项目早期，团队尝试了“一个大的 AGENTS.md”方法。这是一个大型指令文件，包含代理需要了解的关于项目的所有内容、架构、约定和约束。它不出所料地失败了，有四个方面值得我们了解。

First, context is a scarce resource. A giant instruction file crowds out the task, the code, and the relevant documentation. The agent either misses key constraints or starts optimizing for the wrong things. Second, too much guidance becomes non-guidance. When everything is marked as important, nothing is. The agent starts pattern-matching locally instead of navigating intentionally. Third, it rots instantly. A monolithic manual becomes a graveyard of stale rules as the codebase evolves. Fourth, it is hard to verify. A single blob does not lend itself to coverage checks, freshness tracking, or cross-linking. Drift is inevitable.

首先，上下文是一种稀缺资源。庞大的指令文件会挤占任务、代码和相关文档的空间。智能体要么忽略关键约束，要么开始为错误的目标进行优化。第二，过多的指导会失去指导意义。当所有内容都被标记为重要时，实际上就没有什么是重要的了。智能体开始在局部范围内进行模式匹配，而不是有意地进行导航。第三，它会迅速失效。随着代码库的演进，庞大的手册会变成过时规则的坟墓。第四，它难以验证。单一的整体内容无法进行覆盖率检查、时效性追踪或交叉链接。偏差是不可避免的。

The solution was a structured docs/ directory treated as the system of record, with a short AGENTS.md file (roughly 100 lines) serving as a map that pointed to deeper sources of truth elsewhere. Design documentation was catalogued and indexed. Architecture documentation provided a top-level map of domains and package layering. Plans were treated as first-class artifacts with progress and decision logs checked into the repository.

解决方案是一个结构化的 docs/ 目录，被视为事实记录系统，其中包含一个简短的 AGENTS.md 文件（大约 100 行），作为指向其他地方更深入事实来源的地图。设计文档被编目和索引。架构文档提供了领域和包分层的顶层地图。计划被视为一级制品，其进度和决策日志被提交到代码仓库。

This enabled what the team called progressive disclosure: agents started with a small, stable entry point and were taught where to look next, rather than being overwhelmed upfront. The result was that agents could reason about the full business domain directly from the repository, without needing access to external context that might not be available or might be out of date.

这实现了团队所谓的渐进式展示：代理从一个小而稳定的入口点开始，被教导下一步该查看哪里，而不是一开始就被大量信息淹没。结果是，代理可以直接从存储库中推理出完整的业务领域，而无需访问可能不可用或已过时的外部上下文。

## Application Legibility: Making the System Visible to the Agent

应用可读性：使系统对代理可见

As code throughput increased, the bottleneck shifted from generation to verification. The team was generating code faster than human QA capacity could validate it. The solution was to make more of the verification work something agents could do themselves, by making the application directly legible to Codex.

随着代码吞吐量的增加，瓶颈从生成环节转移到了验证环节。团队生成代码的速度超过了人工 QA 的验证能力。解决方案是让更多的验证工作能够由代理自行完成，方法是使应用程序对 Codex 直接可理解。

This involved several concrete investments. They made the application bootable per git worktree, so Codex could launch and drive an isolated instance of the application for each change it was working on. They wired the Chrome DevTools Protocol into the agent runtime and created tools for working with DOM snapshots, screenshots, and browser navigation. This enabled Codex to reproduce bugs, validate fixes, and reason about UI behavior directly, without requiring a human to interact with the application.

这涉及了几项具体的投入。他们让应用程序可以通过每个 git worktree 启动，这样 Codex 就能为其正在处理的每个变更启动并驱动一个隔离的应用实例。他们将 Chrome DevTools 协议集成到代理运行时中，并创建了用于处理 DOM 快照、截图和浏览器导航的工具。这使得 Codex 能够直接复现 bug、验证修复并分析 UI 行为，而无需人工与应用程序交互。

They built a full local observability stack: logs, metrics, and traces exposed to Codex via LogQL, PromQL, and TraceQL. Each agent task ran on a fully isolated version of the application with its own observability data, torn down once the task was complete. This meant agents could debug production-like issues using real observability tools, the same tools a human engineer would use, rather than having to infer behavior from the code alone.

他们构建了一个完整的本地可观测性栈：日志、指标和追踪通过 LogQL、PromQL 和 TraceQL 暴露给 Codex。每个代理任务在应用的一个完全隔离版本上运行，该版本拥有自己的可观测性数据，任务完成后即被销毁。这意味着代理可以使用真实的可观测性工具调试类似生产环境的问题，这些工具与人类工程师使用的工具相同，而不必仅从代码推断行为。

The principle here is the same one the SWE-agent paper demonstrated: the quality of an agent's work is bounded by the quality of its feedback loops. If an agent can see what a user would see, and can observe the same metrics and logs a human engineer would observe, it can catch and fix a much broader class of problems than an agent operating on code alone.

这里的原则与 SWE-agent 论文中展示的原则相同：智能体的工作质量由其反馈循环的质量决定。如果一个智能体能够看到用户能看到的内容，并且能够观察到人类工程师能观察到的相同指标和日志，那么它能够发现并修复比仅基于代码运行的智能体更广泛的一类问题。

## Enforcing Architecture Without Micromanaging

执行架构而不进行微观管理

One of the most interesting challenges in a fully agent-generated codebase is maintaining architectural coherence over time. Codex replicates patterns that already exist in the repository, including uneven or suboptimal ones. Over time, this leads to drift. Bad patterns spread. Inconsistencies accumulate. The codebase becomes harder for future agent runs to navigate correctly.

在完全由代理生成的代码库中，最有趣的挑战之一是随着时间推移保持架构一致性。Codex 会复制代码仓库中已存在的模式，包括不均衡或次优的模式。随着时间的推移，这会导致漂移。不良模式会蔓延，不一致性不断积累。这使得未来代理运行时更难正确导航代码库。

OpenAI's solution was to enforce invariants mechanically, not through human code review. The application was structured around a rigid architectural model: each business domain divided into a fixed set of layers with strictly validated dependency directions and a limited set of permissible edges. These constraints were enforced by custom linters (written by Codex, naturally) and structural tests.

OpenAI 的解决方案是机械地强制不变量，而非通过人工代码审查。该应用程序基于一个僵化的架构模型构建：每个业务领域被划分为固定的多层结构，具有严格验证的依赖方向和有限的允许边集。这些约束由自定义的代码检查器（当然是由 Codex 编写的）和结构测试强制执行。

The key insight was to enforce boundaries while allowing significant freedom within them. The linters checked that code flowed in the right direction through the layer hierarchy. They did not dictate how specific features were implemented within those boundaries. This is the same principle that makes platform teams effective at scale: enforce the foundation, allow autonomy on top of it.

关键洞察是在划定边界的同时，在边界内给予较大自由度。代码检查工具会检查代码是否按照正确的方向在分层结构中流动。它们不会规定在这些边界内如何实现特定功能。这与使平台团队能够规模化高效运作的原则相同：夯实基础，在基础之上给予自主权。

The linters were custom-written specifically to generate helpful error messages for agents. When a linter caught a violation, the error message included remediation instructions formatted for injection into agent context. This closed the loop: the constraint violated, the rule that was violated, and the steps to fix it were all delivered in a single, actionable feedback message.

这些代码检查工具是专门定制编写的，旨在为代理生成有用的错误消息。当检查工具发现违规时，错误消息会包含针对注入代理上下文的修复说明。这形成了一个闭环：被违反的约束、被违反的规则以及修复步骤都通过一条可操作的反馈消息传达出来。

They also encoded what they called "golden principles" directly into the repository: opinionated, mechanical rules that kept the codebase legible and consistent for future agent runs. Prefer shared utility packages over hand-rolled helpers. Validate data shapes at the boundary. These principles were enforced by recurring cleanup background tasks that scanned for deviations, updated quality grades, and opened targeted refactoring pull requests. Most of these could be reviewed in under a minute and automerged.

他们还将所谓的“黄金原则”直接编码到代码仓库中：有明确立场的、机械性的规则，这些规则确保代码库对未来的代理运行保持易读性和一致性。优先选择共享工具包而非手动编写的辅助工具。在边界处验证数据结构。这些原则通过定期清理后台任务来实施，这些任务会扫描偏差、更新质量等级，并发起针对性的重构拉取请求。这些任务中的大多数可以在一分钟内完成审查并自动合并。

## Throughput Changes the Merge Philosophy

吞吐量改变合并理念

When agent throughput dramatically exceeds human attention capacity, conventional engineering norms become counterproductive. Pull requests that sit waiting for review are blocking agent work. Test flakes that are investigated individually are consuming human attention that could be directed at higher-leverage tasks.

当代理吞吐量大幅超过人类注意力容量时，传统工程规范会产生反效果。等待审核的拉取请求正在阻碍代理工作。单独排查的测试波动正在占用本可用于高杠杆任务的人类注意力。

OpenAI's team made a deliberate decision to operate with minimal blocking merge gates. Pull requests were kept short-lived. Test flakes were addressed with follow-up runs rather than blocking progress indefinitely. When agent throughput far exceeds human attention, corrections are cheap and waiting is expensive. The right tradeoff looks irresponsible in a low-throughput environment and obvious in a high-throughput one.

OpenAI 的团队刻意决定以最小化阻塞的合并门方式运作。拉取请求保持为短暂的。测试不稳定通过后续运行来解决，而不是无限期地阻塞进展。当代理吞吐量远远超过人类注意力时，修正成本低而等待成本高。在低吞吐量环境中，合适的权衡显得不负责任，而在高吞吐量环境中则显而易见。

This is a genuinely important insight for teams transitioning to agent-driven development. The merge philosophy that made sense when human engineers wrote every line of code does not automatically make sense when agents are generating 3.5 pull requests per engineer per day. The bottleneck shifts, and the process needs to shift with it.

这对正在向代理驱动开发转型的团队来说是一个真正重要的见解。当人类工程师编写每一行代码时适用的合并理念，在代理每天为每位工程师生成3.5个拉取请求时，就不再自动适用了。瓶颈发生了转移，流程也需要随之调整。

# Part Five: The Awesome Agent Harness Taxonomy

第五部分：超棒的代理框架分类法

## Mapping the Ecosystem

生态系统映射

The Awesome Agent Harness repository, maintained by the AutoJunjie project on GitHub, attempts to map the emerging ecosystem of harness engineering tooling. Its central argument is worth stating explicitly before diving into the taxonomy: the ability of AI to write code is effectively a commodity. Foundation models can produce functional code. That is no longer the differentiating capability. The differentiating capability is coordination and environment design.

由 AutoJunjie 项目在 GitHub 上维护的 Awesome Agent Harness 代码仓库，试图梳理框架工程工具的新兴生态系统。其核心论点在深入分类之前值得明确阐述：AI 编写代码的能力实际上已成为一种商品。基础模型能够生成功能代码。这不再是差异化能力。差异化能力在于协调和环境设计。

The repository catalogs the full stack of what a serious agent harness ecosystem requires, broken into seven distinct layers. Understanding these layers helps explain why "building an AI coding assistant" is actually many separate engineering problems, not one.

代码仓库分类整理了成熟的智能体工具生态系统所需的全栈内容，分为七个不同的层次。理解这些层次有助于解释为什么“构建 AI 编码助手”实际上是多个独立的工程问题，而非一个。

Layer 1: Human Oversight

第一层：人工监督

At the top is the human oversight layer, where humans approve proposals, review pull requests, and set priorities. This is not a technical layer in the traditional sense. It is the interface between human judgment and agent execution. The key design principle here is that engineers should be designing environments and reviewing outcomes, not writing code directly. Their leverage comes from steering, not from executing.

顶部是人类监督层，在这里人类批准提案、审查拉取请求并设定优先级。这不是传统意义上的技术层，而是人类判断与代理执行之间的接口。这里的关键设计原则是，工程师应设计环境和审查结果，而非直接编写代码。他们的影响力来自于引导，而非执行。

Layer 2: Planning and Requirements (Spec Tools)

第2层：规划与需求（规格工具）

This layer translates human ideas into structured specifications and task DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) that agents can consume reliably. The underlying insight is that agents execute blindly. If the specification is vague or ambiguous, the agent will produce something that satisfies its interpretation of the spec, which may not be what the human intended. Spec tools force precision at the requirements stage, before any code is written.

该层将人类想法转化为结构化规范和任务 DAGs（有向无环图），智能体能够可靠地使用这些内容。根本洞察是，智能体是盲目执行的。如果规范模糊或不明确，智能体将生成满足其对规范解读的内容，这可能并非人类的初衷。规范工具在编写任何代码之前，即在需求阶段，强制要求精确性。

One project in this space, Chorus, attempts to solve what the repository calls the "reversed conversation gap." Instead of having humans write detailed spec tickets (a major failure point because humans are not naturally precise in the way agents need them to be), Chorus lets the AI propose task DAGs and elaborate on requirements, with humans in a strict verification and approval role before execution begins. The AI is better at generating complete specifications from partial intent than humans are at writing them from scratch.

该领域中的一个项目 Chorus 试图解决代码仓库称为的“反向对话差距”问题。与其让人类编写详细的规格说明工单（这是一个主要的失败点，因为人类天生无法像智能体所需的那样精确），Chorus 让 AI 提出任务 DAG 并详细说明需求，在执行开始前，人类扮演严格的核实与审批角色。AI 比人类从头编写完整规格说明更擅长从部分意图生成完整规格说明。

Layer 3: Full Lifecycle Platforms

第3层：全生命周期平台

These tools manage the end-to-end process from initial requirements to delivery, integrating AI proposals with human verification gates and sub-agent orchestration. They are the glue between the specification layer and the execution layer, handling state management across the full development lifecycle.

这些工具管理从初始需求到交付的端到端流程，将 AI 提案与人工验证关卡及子代理编排集成。它们是规范层和执行层之间的粘合剂，处理贯穿整个开发生命周期的状态管理。

Layer 4: Task Runners

第4层：任务运行器

Task runners bridge the gap between issue trackers (GitHub Issues, Linear) and coding agents. The flow is: a human or PM agent creates an issue, the task runner spawns a workspace, the agent delivers a pull request, and the human reviews. Tools in this category include systems that continuously poll task queues, decide when to spawn agents, and deliver completed work without requiring human involvement in the execution loop.

任务运行器弥合了问题跟踪系统（GitHub Issues、Linear）与编码代理之间的差距。流程如下：人类或产品经理代理创建一个问题，任务运行器生成一个工作空间，代理提交拉取请求，然后由人类进行审查。此类工具包括持续轮询任务队列、决定何时生成代理以及在执行循环中无需人类参与即可交付已完成工作的系统。

Layer 5: Agent Orchestrators

第5层：代理编排器

Orchestrators solve the throughput problem by enabling parallel execution of multiple agents while isolating their work in separate git worktrees. This is critical because agents working in parallel on the same codebase will conflict with each other if they share a workspace. Git worktree isolation gives each agent its own sandbox, allowing many agents to work simultaneously without stepping on each other.

编排器通过允许多个代理并行执行，同时将其工作隔离在单独的 Git 工作树中，解决了吞吐量问题。这一点至关重要，因为在同一代码库上并行工作的代理如果共享一个工作空间，将会发生冲突。Git 工作树隔离为每个代理提供了专属的沙箱，允许多个代理同时工作而互不干扰。

Tools like Vibe Kanban, Emdash, and Composio implement this pattern. Each agent task gets its own git worktree. Changes are validated in isolation before being merged. CI feedback, merge conflicts, and coordination between agents are all handled by the orchestration layer rather than requiring human intervention.

工具如 Vibe Kanban、Emdash 和 Composio 实现了这种模式。每个代理任务都会获得自己的 Git 工作树。在合并之前，会在独立环境中验证变更。CI 反馈、合并冲突以及代理之间的协调均由编排层处理，而非需要人工干预。

Layer 6: Agent Harness Frameworks and Runtimes

第6层：代理管理框架和运行时

Frameworks provide composable primitives for building custom environments: progressive disclosure mechanisms, sub-agent spawning, structured context delivery. Runtimes provide persistent infrastructure: long-running memory, scheduled execution, multi-channel communication between sessions.

框架提供可组合原语，用于构建自定义环境：渐进式披露机制、子代理生成、结构化上下文传递。运行时提供持久化基础设施：长期运行的内存、计划执行、会话间多通道通信。

The distinction between a framework and a runtime is important. A framework is what you build on. A runtime is what keeps running. The Claude Agent SDK is primarily a framework. A system that runs agents on a cron schedule, maintains persistent memory across sessions, and handles multi-channel coordination between agent instances is a runtime. Both are necessary for serious long-running agentic work.

框架和运行时之间的区别很重要。框架是你构建的基础。运行时是持续运行的东西。Claude 代理 SDK 主要是一个框架。在 cron 调度下运行代理、在会话间维护持久内存，以及处理代理实例之间多渠道协调的系统是运行时。这两者对于严肃的长期代理工作都是必要的。

Layer 7: Coding Agents

第7层：编码代理

At the bottom is the execution layer: Claude Code, Codex, and similar systems that write, test, and debug code. The key insight of the repository is that this layer is a commodity. The agent's effectiveness is primarily determined by everything above it in the stack, not by the agent itself.

最底层是执行层：Claude Code、Codex 以及类似的编写、测试和调试代码的系统。代码仓库的关键见解是，这一层是一种商品。智能体的有效性主要由其在技术栈中上方的所有组件决定，而非智能体本身。

This is a provocative claim that the evidence supports. The SWE-agent paper demonstrated it empirically: same model, 64% performance improvement from interface design. OpenAI's Codex team demonstrated it operationally: the engineering work that mattered was environment design, not execution. Anthropic's harness engineering work demonstrated it practically: the initializer agent setup determined whether the coding agents could make progress at all.

这是一个有证据支持的有争议的说法。SWE-agent 论文通过实证证明了这一点：相同模型下，界面设计带来了 64%的性能提升。OpenAI 的 Codex 团队从操作层面证明了这一点：关键的工程工作是环境设计而非执行。Anthropic 的工具链工程工作从实际应用角度证明了这一点：初始化代理设置决定了编码代理是否能取得任何进展。

# Part Six: The Design Patterns That Repeat

第六部分：重复的设计模式

Across all of these systems and all of these organizations, several design patterns appear repeatedly. They are not coincidences. They are engineering solutions to problems that emerge whenever you try to deploy agents reliably at scale.

在所有这些系统和所有这些组织中，几种设计模式反复出现。它们并非偶然。它们是当你试图大规模可靠地部署代理时出现的问题的工程解决方案。

## Pattern 1: Progressive Disclosure

模式1：渐进式展开

Do not give the agent everything it might need upfront. Give it the minimum it needs to orient itself and the pointers to find more when it needs it. This pattern appears in the SWE-agent's capped search (do not return all results, force the agent to refine), in OpenAI's docs/ architecture (a short map pointing to deeper truth), in Anthropic's startup sequence (read the progress file first, then the feature list), and in the harness frameworks that implement structured context layering.

不要一开始就给代理它可能需要的所有东西。而是给它最少的必要信息来定位自身，并提供当它需要时能找到更多信息的指引。这种模式出现在 SWE 代理的有限搜索（不要返回所有结果，而是迫使代理进行优化）、OpenAI 的文档/架构（一个指向更深入本质的简短路线图）、Anthropic 的启动序列（先读取进度文件，然后是功能列表），以及实现结构化上下文分层的框架中。

The cognitive reason for this pattern is that context is a finite resource, and the agent's attention is not uniformly distributed across it. Information presented at the beginning of a prompt has disproportionate influence. A short, focused entry point that points to richer context elsewhere is more effective than a comprehensive dump that dilutes attention across everything.

这种模式的认知原因在于，上下文是一种有限资源，且智能体的注意力并非均匀分布在其上。提示词开头呈现的信息会产生不成比例的影响。一个简短且集中、指向其他地方更丰富上下文的切入点，比一个全面堆砌信息、分散对所有内容注意力的方式更有效。

The practical reason is maintenance. A short entry point that serves as a map to deeper documentation is something you can keep accurate. A monolithic document containing everything quickly becomes stale and counterproductive.

实际原因是维护。一个简短的入口点，作为深入文档的地图，是你可以保持准确的内容。一份包含所有内容的庞大文档很快就会过时且适得其反。

## Pattern 2: Git Worktree Isolation

模式 2：Git 工作树隔离

One agent, one worktree. This pattern appears in every serious orchestration system. The reasoning is straightforward: when you have multiple agents working in parallel (or when a single agent is running tasks in sequence), you need isolation between work streams. Without isolation, parallel agents will step on each other's changes. Even with sequential agents, you want the ability to validate changes in an isolated environment before they affect the main codebase.

一个代理，一个工作树。这种模式在每一个严谨的编排系统中都存在。其逻辑很简单：当多个代理并行工作（或单个代理按顺序执行任务）时，工作流之间需要隔离。如果没有隔离，并行的代理会互相覆盖对方的修改。即使是顺序执行的代理，也需要在修改影响主代码库之前，能够在隔离环境中验证这些修改。

Git worktrees provide this isolation at the filesystem level. Each agent gets its own working directory, its own branch, and its own environment. Changes are made in isolation, tested in isolation, and merged only when they pass validation. This is how modern CI/CD systems work for human engineers, and it turns out to be exactly the right model for agent orchestration as well.

Git 工作树在文件系统级别提供了这种隔离。每个代理都拥有自己的工作目录、自己的分支和自己的环境。变更在隔离环境中进行，在隔离环境中测试，只有通过验证后才会合并。这正是现代 CI/CD 系统为人类工程师设计的工作方式，事实证明，这也正是代理编排的理想模型。

## Pattern 3: Spec First, Repository as System of Record

模式 3: 先规范，代码仓库作为事实记录系统

Agents are blind to informal knowledge. Anything that lives in a Slack thread, a Google Doc, or someone's head is invisible to the agent. The only thing the agent can work with is what is in its context window, and the only reliable source for that context is the repository.

代理无法感知非正式知识。任何存在于 Slack 线程、Google 文档或某人脑海中的内容，代理都无法感知。代理唯一能处理的内容是其上下文窗口中的信息，而该上下文的唯一可靠来源是代码仓库。

This pattern shows up as the feature list file in Anthropic's harness, as the structured docs/ directory in OpenAI's system, as AGENTS.md files in various open-source frameworks, and as the spec tools layer in the awesome-agent-harness taxonomy. The common thread is that specifications, requirements, architectural decisions, and constraints must be encoded into machine-readable files in the repository before execution begins. If the agent cannot read it from the repo, it does not exist.

这种模式表现为 Anthropic 的测试框架中的功能列表文件，OpenAI 系统中的结构化 docs/目录，各种开源框架中的 AGENTS.md 文件，以及 awesome-agent-harness 分类体系中的规范工具层。共同核心是，在执行开始之前，规范、需求、架构决策和约束必须被编码到代码仓库中的机器可读文件中。如果智能体无法从代码仓库中读取它，那么它就不存在。

This has an important implication for how engineering teams should document their work. Documentation is no longer just for human readers. It is the mechanism through which human intent becomes legible to agents. Documentation that is ambiguous, stale, or stored outside the repository is documentation that actively impairs agent performance.

这对工程团队应如何记录其工作具有重要意义。文档不再仅仅是为人类读者准备的。它是人类意图能够被代理理解的机制。模糊、过时或存储在代码仓库之外的文档，会严重损害代理的性能。

## Pattern 4: Mechanical Architecture Enforcement

模式4：机械架构实施

Human code review does not scale to agent-driven development. When an agent can open 3.5 pull requests per engineer per day, review cannot be the primary mechanism for maintaining code quality and architectural integrity. The solution is to encode architectural constraints as mechanical checks that run automatically.

人工代码审查无法适应代理驱动开发。当一个代理每天能为每位工程师提交3.5个拉取请求时，审查就不能再作为维护代码质量和架构完整性的主要机制。解决方案是将架构约束编码为自动运行的机械检查。

Custom linters, structural tests, and CI pipelines replace much of what code review does in human-driven development. The advantage is that mechanical checks are consistent, fast, and provide immediate feedback at the point of violation. A linter that catches an architectural violation and returns a remediation instruction in the error message is more effective than a code reviewer who catches the same violation three days later in a pull request comment.

自定义代码检查工具、结构测试和 CI 流水线取代了人类驱动开发中代码审查的大部分工作。优势在于自动化检查一致、快速，并且能在违规发生时提供即时反馈。一个能够捕获架构性违规并在错误消息中返回修复建议的代码检查工具，比三天后才在拉取请求评论中发现同样违规的代码审查者更有效。

The key design principle is to enforce invariants, not implementations. You care deeply about dependency directions, boundary crossing, data validation at interfaces, and consistency in naming and structure. You do not care which specific library the agent uses or exactly how a function is decomposed, as long as it satisfies the behavioral contract. This gives agents significant autonomy within a well-defined structure.

关键设计原则是确保不变量，而非实现细节。你非常关注依赖方向、边界跨越、接口数据验证以及命名和结构的一致性。你并不关心代理使用哪个特定库，也不关心函数具体如何分解，只要它满足行为契约即可。这使得代理在定义明确的结构中拥有显著的自主性。

## Pattern 5: Integrated Feedback Loops

模式5：集成反馈循环

Every high-performing harness architecture closes the feedback loop as tightly as possible. Syntax errors caught by linters at edit time. Runtime errors surfaced through observability tools the agent can query. UI bugs caught through browser automation the agent can drive. Test failures returned with context about what broke and where.

每个高性能的测试架构都会尽可能紧密地闭合反馈循环。编辑时由代码检查工具捕获的语法错误、代理可查询的可观测性工具所呈现的运行时错误、代理可驱动的浏览器自动化所捕获的界面错误，以及返回包含出错位置和错误详情上下文信息的测试失败。

The alternative, agents writing code that gets tested externally and produces failure messages that feed back in a later session, is slower, more expensive in tokens, and more likely to produce cascading failures. Every point in the feedback loop where the gap between action and consequence can be reduced is a point where agent performance can be improved.

另一种方法是代理编写代码，这些代码会被外部测试，并生成失败消息，这些消息会在后续会话中反馈回来。这种方法更慢，在 token 上的成本更高，并且更可能产生级联失败。反馈循环中任何一个可以缩小行动与结果之间差距的点，都是可以提升代理性能的点。

This is the harness version of the classic software engineering principle about catching errors early. The earlier you catch an error, the cheaper it is to fix. For agents, this applies with even more force because errors that are not caught immediately accumulate in context and degrade the quality of subsequent reasoning.

这是经典软件工程原则“尽早发现错误”的实践版本。发现错误越早，修复成本越低。对于智能体而言，这一原则适用性更强，因为未被及时发现的错误会在上下文中累积，从而降低后续推理的质量。

# Part Seven: What This Actually Means for Engineers

第七部分：这实际上对工程师意味着什么

## The Skill That Transfers

可转移的技能

The harness engineering discipline is, at its core, systems thinking applied to agent environments. It requires you to understand the cognitive architecture of language models well enough to design environments that work with it rather than against it. It requires you to think about state management, feedback loops, error recovery, and context optimization in ways that are familiar from distributed systems engineering but applied to a new domain.

框架工程学科的核心是将系统思维应用于智能体环境。它要求你充分理解语言模型的认知架构，以便设计出能够与其协同工作而非与之对抗的环境。它要求你以分布式系统工程中熟悉的方式思考状态管理、反馈循环、错误恢复和上下文优化，但将这些方法应用到一个新的领域。

The engineers who are most effective in this emerging paradigm are not the ones with the best prompting skills, though prompting matters. They are the ones who understand how the whole system works: how context flows, where it gets corrupted, how feedback loops can be tightened, how state can be preserved across sessions, and how constraints can be enforced without micromanaging the agent's behavior.

在这种新兴范式中最有效的工程师，并非那些拥有最佳提示技能的人，尽管提示确实很重要。他们是那些理解整个系统如何运作的人：上下文如何流动，上下文在哪里被破坏，如何收紧反馈循环，如何在会话间保留状态，以及如何在不微观管理代理行为的情况下实施约束。

These are not new skills in the abstract. They are extensions of skills that good software engineers already have. System design, API design, error handling, testing strategy. What is new is the domain: designing environments for LM agents rather than interfaces for humans.

抽象地说，这些并不是新技能。它们是优秀软件工程师已具备技能的延伸。系统设计、API 设计、错误处理、测试策略。新的地方在于领域：为语言模型代理设计环境，而非为人类设计界面。

## The Questions You Should Be Asking

你应该问的问题

When you are building an agent system and something is not working, the harness engineering mindset produces a different set of questions than the naive mindset.

当你构建代理系统时，如果某些部分不工作，测试框架工程思维会提出与朴素思维不同的一系列问题。

Instead of "how do I write a better prompt?" you ask "what information does the agent need that it currently cannot access?" Instead of "why is the model making this mistake?" you ask "what feedback loop is missing that would catch this mistake before it propagates?" Instead of "why is the agent not doing what I told it to?" you ask "what constraint in the environment is preventing the agent from doing what I told it to?"

与其问“我该如何写出更好的提示词？”，不如问“代理需要哪些当前无法获取的信息？”；与其问“为什么模型会犯这个错误？”，不如问“缺少了哪个反馈循环，使得这个错误在传播之前能够被捕获？”；与其问“为什么代理没有按照我的指示执行？”，不如问“环境中存在什么约束条件，导致代理无法按照我的指示执行？”

This shift is not just semantic. It changes where you invest your engineering effort. Investing in a better prompt that solves this specific failure mode is local and temporary. Investing in a better tool that prevents a category of failure modes is general and permanent. The harness is where that permanent investment lives.

这种转变不仅仅是语义上的。它改变了你在工程投入上的方向。针对解决这一特定故障模式的更优提示词的投入是局部且临时的。而针对防止某类故障模式的更优工具的投入则是全局且永久性的。框架正是这类永久性投入的所在。

## The Commoditization of Execution

执行的商品化

There is an uncomfortable implication in the awesome-agent-harness repository's central argument that deserves to be stated plainly. If the execution layer is a commodity, then the long-term competitive moat in AI-driven development is not in the model. It is in the harness.

awesome-agent-harness 代码仓库的核心论点中存在一个令人不安的暗示，值得明确指出。如果执行层是商品，那么 AI 驱动的开发中的长期竞争护城河不在于模型，而在于框架。

This means that organizations and individuals who invest in harness engineering, in building the scaffolding, the feedback loops, the observability, the spec tooling, and the orchestration that allows agents to do reliable work at scale, will have a durable advantage over those who are focused primarily on which model to use or how to prompt it.

这意味着，那些在 Harness 工程方面进行投入，同时致力于构建脚手架、反馈循环、可观测性、规范工具以及编排（这些基础设施），从而使智能代理能够在规模化场景下执行可靠工作的组织和个人，将比那些主要关注使用哪种模型或如何提示模型的人拥有持久优势。

OpenAI's Codex team built the equivalent of a custom development platform for their specific codebase and domain. Anthropic built a harness architecture that enables months of incremental progress on complex applications. The SWE-agent team built an interface that produces 64% better results from the same model. None of these advantages came from the model. They all came from the environment.

OpenAI 的 Codex 团队为其特定代码库和领域构建了一个等效的定制开发平台。Anthropic 构建了一个 harness 架构，该架构能在复杂应用上实现数月的渐进式进展。SWE-agent 团队构建了一个界面，该界面使用相同模型可产生 64%的更佳结果。这些优势中没有一个来自模型，它们都来自环境。

The model is what thinks. The harness is what thinks about. Getting that distinction right is the entire game.

模型是思考的主体，框架是思考的对象。正确区分这一点就是整个关键。

# Part Eight: Building Your Own Harness

第八部分：构建你自己的测试框架

## The Minimal Harness

极简框架

You do not need to build OpenAI's observability stack or Anthropic's full two-agent architecture to benefit from harness thinking. The minimal effective harness for a coding agent on a real project has a small number of essential components.

要利用框架思维（harness thinking），你无需构建 OpenAI 的可观测性栈或 Anthropic 的完整双智能体架构。在实际项目中，编码智能体的最小有效框架仅包含少量必要组件。

Start with a persistent progress file. Something the agent reads at the beginning of every session to understand what was done last time, and writes at the end of every session to document what it did. This single change prevents the "declare victory too early" failure mode and ensures continuity across context window boundaries.

从一个持久化进度文件开始。代理在每次会话开始时读取该文件以了解上次的操作，在每次会话结束时写入该文件以记录本次操作。这一改动可防止“过早宣告胜利”的失败模式，并确保跨上下文窗口边界的连续性。

Add a structured task list. Not a vague description of the project, but a specific, enumerated list of verifiable completion criteria. Each item should describe a user-visible behavior that can be tested end-to-end. Mark each item with a status that the agent updates only after verification. This prevents the "partially done looks done" failure mode.

添加一个结构化的任务列表。不是对项目的模糊描述，而是一个具体的、可列举的、可核实的完成标准列表。每个条目应描述一种用户可见的、可进行端到端测试的行为。为每个条目标记一个状态，代理仅在核实后更新该状态。这可防止“部分完成却看起来已完成”的失败模式。

Add version control with descriptive commit messages as a first-class part of every session. Every session ends with a commit. The agent should not consider its work done until the code is committed and the progress file is updated. This creates the clean handoff that makes multi-session work coherent.

将版本控制（包含描述性提交信息）作为每次会话的核心部分。每次会话都以一次提交结束。代理只有在代码已提交且进度文件已更新后，才会认为工作完成。这会创建干净的交接，使多会话工作连贯。

If you are building a web application, add browser automation. The difference between an agent that can only read code and an agent that can actually use the application it is building is the same as the difference between a developer who can only read code and a developer who can run the application. Most of the bugs that matter are only visible at runtime.

如果你正在构建 Web 应用程序，请添加浏览器自动化。只能阅读代码的代理与能够实际使用其正在构建的应用程序的代理之间的区别，与只能阅读代码的开发者和能够运行该应用程序的开发者之间的区别是相同的。大多数重要的错误仅在运行时可见。

## The Environment Audit

环境审计

If you already have an agent system and it is underperforming, the harness engineering approach suggests a specific diagnostic process. Rather than reaching for a better model or a longer prompt, you do an environment audit.

如果您已经拥有一个代理系统且其表现不佳，框架工程（harness engineering）方法建议采用特定的诊断流程。与其寻求更好的模型或更长的提示词，不如进行环境审计。

Ask: what information does the agent need that it does not currently have access to? Where are the points in the task flow where the agent regularly gets stuck or makes mistakes? What feedback is missing that would allow the agent to catch those mistakes itself? Where is context getting polluted with irrelevant information? What constraints need to be enforced that are currently relying on agent judgment?

代理需要哪些当前无法获取的信息？任务流程中，代理经常在哪些环节卡住或犯错？哪些反馈缺失，使得代理能够自行发现这些错误？上下文在哪些环节被无关信息污染？当前依赖代理判断的哪些约束需要被实施？

Each of these questions points to a specific harness improvement. Missing information becomes a new tool or a new document in the repository. Missing feedback becomes a new test, linter, or observability integration. Context pollution becomes a new context management strategy. Unenforced constraints become new mechanical checks.

这些问题中的每一个都指向一个特定的测试框架改进。缺失的信息会成为代码仓库中的新工具或新文档。缺失的反馈会成为新的测试、代码检查工具或可观测性集成。上下文污染会成为新的上下文管理策略。未强制执行的约束会成为新的机械检查。

This is the virtuous cycle of harness development: every failure is a signal about what the environment needs, and every improvement to the environment reduces the frequency of that failure across all future agent sessions.

这是测试框架开发的良性循环：每次失败都是关于环境需求的信号，对环境的每次改进都会降低所有未来代理会话中该失败的发生频率。

# The Last Thing

最后一件事

There is a pattern in how transformative technologies get misunderstood in their early phases. The thing that captures public attention, the raw capability, the impressive demo, the benchmark score, is rarely the thing that determines who wins in the long run. The infrastructure layer, the harness, the environment, is usually where the real value gets created and captured.

变革性技术在早期阶段容易被误解，这种现象有一定规律。吸引公众关注的东西、原始能力、令人印象深刻的演示、基准分数，很少是决定谁能在长期竞争中胜出的关键。基础设施层、支撑系统、运行环境，通常才是真正的价值得以创造和实现的地方。

The web was transformative not because HTML existed but because search engines and browsers made the web navigable. Mobile was transformative not because smartphones existed but because app stores and developer tools made it possible to build on top of smartphones at scale. In both cases, the platform layer that organized the underlying capability was where the durable value lived.

互联网具有变革性，不是因为 HTML 的存在，而是因为搜索引擎和浏览器使互联网变得可导航。移动领域具有变革性，不是因为智能手机的存在，而是因为应用商店和开发者工具使得能够大规模地在智能手机上构建应用成为可能。在这两种情况下，整合了底层能力的平台层，正是持久价值的所在地。

AI agents are following the same pattern. The capability exists. The question is who builds the environments that make the capability reliable, controllable, and continuously improvable. The SWE-agent researchers understood this in 2024 and demonstrated it quantitatively. Anthropic understood it building Claude Code and documented it openly. OpenAI understood it building their internal product and shared the lessons. The awesome-agent-harness community is cataloging it across dozens of tools and frameworks.

AI 代理正在遵循相同的模式。这种能力已经存在。问题在于谁构建了使这种能力可靠、可控且持续可改进的环境。SWE-agent 研究人员在 2024 年就理解了这一点，并进行了量化验证。Anthropic 通过构建 Claude Code 理解了这一点，并公开记录了相关内容。OpenAI 通过构建其内部产品理解了这一点，并分享了经验教训。awesome-agent-harness 社区正在通过数十种工具和框架对其进行梳理。

The harness is everything. The model is the reasoning engine. The harness is the context, the constraints, the feedback loops, the memory, the tools, and the scaffolding that determines what the reasoning engine can actually accomplish. Getting the harness right is not a prompt engineering problem. It is a systems engineering problem. And it is the most important engineering problem in applied AI right now.

框架是一切的核心。模型是推理引擎。框架是上下文、约束条件、反馈循环、记忆、工具以及决定推理引擎实际能完成什么的支撑结构。把框架设计好并非提示工程问题，而是系统工程问题。这是当前应用 AI 领域最重要的工程问题。

Build accordingly.

相应地构建
