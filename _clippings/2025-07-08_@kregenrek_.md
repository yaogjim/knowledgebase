Before starting implementation with Claude Code, I usually prompt it with something like, "Read @ XX-docs .md. Ask me 5 clarifying questions and think harder."

Sometimes I answer them myself and sometimes I just don't want to think about the answer. So I put it back to my initial plan in o3 and tell it "Here are 3 questions. Decide here whats best for my usecase".

So in the end, I'm just supervising. Getting lazy.

After the implementation has been finished, I usually tell Cursor to do some test calls with Curl if it's an API, or it should provide some parameters for the UI testing part.

Then, you proceed with fine-grained bug fixing.
