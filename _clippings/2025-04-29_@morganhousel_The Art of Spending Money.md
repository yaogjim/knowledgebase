If The Psychology of Money was about the mindset of growing wealth, this book focuses on how to use it.

I don't lecture you how to spend, because everyone is different. This book is about:

\-Attention

\-Envy

\-Social aspiration

\-Comfort

\-Happiness

\-Regret

\-Much more

On a related note, what books would you recommend for a high schooler who just starting to think about money seriously (just started working, etc.)
