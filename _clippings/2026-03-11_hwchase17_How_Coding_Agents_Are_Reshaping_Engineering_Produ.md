# How Coding Agents Are Reshaping Engineering, Product and Design

**Harrison Chase**

# How Coding Agents Are Reshaping Engineering, Product and Design

EPD (Engineering, Product, and Design) at software company is about creating good software. Separate roles exist, but the end goal is functional software that solves a business problem that users can use. At the end of the day, this is just code. It is important to recognize that the output of what EPD as a function builds is just code because… coding agents have suddenly made code very easy to write. So how does this change the role of EPD?

The changing process:

- PRDs are dead
- The bottleneck shifts from implementation to review
- Long live PRDs

Impact on roles:

- Generalists are more valuable than ever
- Coding agents are a requirement
- Good PMs are great, bad PMs are terrible
- Everyone needs product sense
- The bar for specialization is higher
- You're either a builder or a reviewer
- Everyone thinks their role is most advantaged by coding agents - and they are right

## PRDs are dead

PRDs (Product Requirement Documents) were the focal point of building software in the pre-Claude era. The EPD process was largely:

- Someone (usually product) has an idea
- Product writes a PRD
- Design takes PRD and creates a mock
- Engineering turns mock into code

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HC-8z9YbsAAL5Ql?format=png&name=large)

This wasn’t a hard and fast rule (at startups these steps blended together, the best builders were able to do multiple of these together) but it was the textbook way to build things.

This was required because building the software (and building the mock) required a significant amount of time and effort. So disciplines were created to specialize in those efforts. As people became more specialized, there then became a need to communicate across those disciplines. The PRD was the basis of that, which kickstarted everything. It would then waterfall to design, who would turn pretty words into a pretty UI and smooth UX. Engineering would then make that real.

Coding agents change all of that. Coding agents can take an idea and create functional software. When I (and others) say “PRDs are dead” what we really mean is this traditional way of building software, starting with the writing of a PRD, is dead.

## The bottleneck shifts from implementation to review

Anyone can write code now, which means anyone can build things. That does not mean the things that are built are well architected, or solve the right problems, or easy to use. Engineering, Product, and Design should be the reviewers and arbitrators of these areas. The issue is the code generated isn’t always “great”. The role of EPD becomes reviewing and making sure it is “great”. “great” can mean several things:

- Well architected from an engineering systems perspective: is it written in a scalable, performant, robust way?
- Well thought out from a product perspective: does this solve the user pain point?
- Well designed: are the interfaces easy and intuitive to use?

Since the cost of creating some initial version of the code is so cheap, we see that a lot more prototypes are created. Those prototypes then serve as a focal point, with Product, Engineering, and Design reviewing them.

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HC-83ZWbkAAt-rX?format=png&name=large)

The issue is - it’s so easy to generate code. Previously, it took a while to create the code - so as a reviewer there were only so many projects coming across your desk for review at any given point. Now though - anyone can write code. That means the number of projects going on is increasing. We’ve seen the bottleneck (in all three functions) be review - taking the prototypes and making sure they are “good”.

## Long live PRDs

The pre-Claude era of building software (starting with a PRD) is gone. But documents describing product requirements are still essential.

Let’s assume someone has an idea and quickly builds a prototype. How does this get into production? It needs to be reviewed by other members of EPD. As part of this process, a written document always helps and is often essential. When others are reviewing, how are they to know if part of the code is there by accident or on purpose? Depends on the intent. Some communication of this intent is needed.

I think the traditional PRD process (PRD → mock → code) is dead. But text that describes product requirements is very much alive. This associated document should be a required companion to the prototype before being handed off for review.

The most standard format would be a document, but there are some interesting ideas around sharing the prompts used to create this feature as a way to communicate that. What if PRDs of the future are just structured, versioned prompts?

## Generalists are more valuable than ever

By generalists I mean people with a good sense of all three of product, engineering and design. These people were always valuable and impactful - but with coding agents they are even more so. Why?

Communication is the hardest part of everything. It slows things down. One person who can do all of product, design, and engineering will move faster than a team of three because of the communication overhead.

Previously, when implementation was the blocker, this generalist still had to communicate with others to get work done. Now they can just communicate with agents. This means they can be far more impactful by just themselves than ever before.

## Coding agents are a requirement

With coding agents making implementation cheap, using them is a requirement. People who can adopt coding agents will be able to do more by themselves:

- PMs who adopt coding agents can validate ideas by building prototypes directly, without writing a spec and waiting
- Designers who adopt coding agents can iterate in code, not just in Figma
- Engineers who adopt coding agents can shift their time from implementation to system thinking

Adopting coding agents is a requirement because it is not hard to do so, and if you don’t do you so you will be replaced by someone who does.

## Good PMs are great, bad PMs are terrible

Good product thinking is more valuable than ever - you can build things that are useful. Bad product thinking is more wasteful than ever. If someone has a bad product idea, they can show up with a prototype - but that prototype will be of a feature that is useless, or poorly conceived. These prototypes now require more reviews - from engineering, product and design. This sucks up time and resources. There is also more inertia to get these prototypes into production (”It already exists! Let’s just merge it!”). This risks creating a worse or bloated product.

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HC-8-I_aUAAenyg?format=png&name=large)

## System thinking is the skill to hone

In a world where execution is cheap, system thinking becomes the differentiator. You should focus on being really good at systems thinking and have a clear mental model of your particular domain:

- Engineering: really good mental model of how to architect services and APIs and databases
- Product: really good mental model of what users actually need, not what they say they want
- Design: really good mental model of why something looks and feels right to use

System thinking has always been important - so what has changed? The cost of implementation went way down. This means that it is easier than ever to implement something - but that doesn’t mean it’s great. Being a good system thinker allows you make sure you are building the right things upfront. It also lets you review others work after the fact. Both mean that the importance of being a good system thinker has grown.

## Everyone needs product sense

Coding agents still need someone to prompt them. Someone to tell them what to do. If you tell them to build the wrong thing - you are creating more slop for others to review. Knowing what to tell the agent to build (”product sense”) is a requirement, or you will be a drag on the org. This is true across engineering, design, and (obviously) product.

A big part of EPD is now reviewing prototypes. Reviewing is easier if you have product sense, even for reviewing design/engineering. If you don’t have product sense, you need a super detailed product document along side the prototype. If you do have product sense you understand the intent of the feature with a minimal spec, speeding up communication, review, and delivery.

## The bar for specialization is higher

You need to know how to use coding agents. You need product sense. All the roles are blending together.

There’s always been overlap in roles. Design and product have long been linked -a t certain companies like Apple and AirBnb, designers serve as product managers. “Design engineer” as a role has been picking up steam at companies like Vercel.

This doesn’t mean there is no room for specialization. A very senior engineer who just thinks about the system architecture is still valuable. As is a PM who hasn’t picked up vibe coding but does have a super clear mental model of the customers problems and what to build. Same with a designer who can understand and mock user journeys and interactions, even if still in Figma.

But the bar for specialization is much higher. You have to be not only fantastic at your domain, but also incredibly fast at review and an incredible communicator. And there probably aren’t that many of these roles at any given company.

## You’re either a builder or a reviewer

We see two different types of roles emerging in EPD.

First: the builder. This archetype has good product thinking, they are capable of using coding agents, and have baseline design intuition. With guardrails around them (test suite, component library) they can take small features from idea to production, and prototype functional versions of larger ones.

Second: the reviewer. For large and complicated features, detailed EPD review is required. The bar for this is high - you have to be a fantastic systems thinker in your domain. You also have to work at a fast pace - there is a lot to review.

If you are an engineer right now - you should either aim to get fantastic at system design and comfortable reviewing architectures and aim to be a reviewer… or try to grow your product/design skills and become a builder.

If you are in product or design - you either have to have a fantastic mental model for product/design and largely review, or jump into coding agents and improving your coding chops.

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HC-9h1ObEAAqqAh?format=jpg&name=large)

Whats interesting is that roles are kind of collapsing, as shown by all of EPD being somewhere on the above chart. Roles can start to blend together - engineers have more time, can think more on product and design. Product and design can create code.

## Everyone thinks their role is most advantaged by coding agents - and they are right

There was a

[great post on Twitter](https://x.com/signulll/status/2030404483897815089) about the type of people most advantaged by coding agents:

> someone with an intuitive grasp of the product as it exists, where it's soft, where it sings, & how to iterate it toward something even sharper.

> the rarest version of this person sits at the intersection of culture & deep technology. someone genuinely bilingual. they know what's technically possible & they know which cultural currents are real vs. ephemeral. that combo is what separates products that feel inevitable from products that feel assembled.

The post was a great encapsulation of this new world, and it went semi-viral. Part of the reason it went viral was everyone reading it thought it was about them or their role. I saw product people quoting it, designers, design engineers, founders… everyone thought it applied to them and their role.

And they were all probably right! I think the great and exciting thing about this new world is that backgrounds matter less. I genuinely believe this archetype of person could come from product, design, or engineering. That doesn’t mean everyone will be this person - it’s much easier said than done. There are very few true unicorns out there

It’s an exciting time to be building :)

### 📋 提示词模板: 结构化

> *(已省略完整内容)*

### 🤖 AI

**主旨概括：**  
文章核心观点是：**编码代理让 “写代码” 变得极其便宜，软件开发的核心瓶颈不再是 “做出来”，而是 “做对、做好、审好”**。这会重塑工程、产品、设计（EPD）的分工：角色边界变模糊，通才更值钱，评审能力和产品判断力变得更重要。

---

## 1. 传统 EPD 流程正在被改写：“PRD 先行” 不再是默认起点
- 过去的经典流程是：**产品提想法 → 写 PRD → 设计出 mock → 工程实现代码**。  
- 之所以这样做，是因为以前**做软件和原型很贵、很慢**，所以必须靠文档来协调不同专业的人。  
- 文章认为，随着编码代理出现，**“先写 PRD、再做产品” 的旧流程已经过时**，因为现在一个想法可以很快直接变成可运行原型。  
- 简单说：**PRD 没完全消失，但它不再是开发的唯一起点。**

**例子：**  
以前一个 PM 想验证功能，通常要先写完整需求，再排期给设计和工程；现在可能先用编码代理快速做个原型，再拿去讨论。

---

## 2. 真正的瓶颈，从 “实现” 转移到了 “评审”
- 现在**任何人都更容易生成代码和原型**，所以项目和想法会大量增加。  
- 但 “能做出来” 不等于 “做得好”。评审要判断三个层面：  
  - **工程**：架构是否可扩展、稳定、高性能  
  - **产品**：是否真的解决用户痛点  
  - **设计**：是否易用、直观  
- 因为原型产出速度大幅提升，EPD 团队的压力会转向：**要审更多东西、筛掉差的东西、打磨好的东西**。  

**关键变化：**  
以前桌上待评审的项目有限；现在由于生成太容易，**评审成为新的组织瓶颈**。

---

## 3. “PRD 已死”，但 “需求说明” 反而更重要了
- 文章强调：**传统 PRD 流程死了，但表达产品意图的文档没死**。  
- 当一个人先做出原型后，要推进到生产环境，别人仍然需要知道：  
  - 哪些功能是故意设计的  
  - 哪些只是原型阶段 “顺手生成” 的  
  - 这个功能到底想解决什么问题  
- 所以，**原型提交评审时，仍然需要配套说明文档**。  
- 未来这种文档未必是传统 PRD，也可能是：  
  - 精简规格说明  
  - 结构化提示词  
  - 可版本管理的 prompt

**一句话总结：**  
不是不要文档，而是**文档从 “开发前置物” 变成 “原型后的解释物”**。

---

## 4. 通才会比以前更有价值
- 作者所说的通才，是指**同时懂产品、设计、工程的人**。  
- 原因很简单：**沟通本来就是最慢的环节**。  
- 以前通才即使懂很多，也还要依赖别人落地；现在有了编码代理，通才可以直接把想法做成原型。  
- 这意味着：**一个人 + 代理，可能比三个人协作推进更快**。

**核心原因：**  
编码代理降低了 “执行成本”，而通才刚好能减少 “沟通成本”，两者叠加，价值更高。

---

## 5. 会用编码代理，将成为基本要求
- 文章认为，使用编码代理很快会从 “加分项” 变成 “必需项”。  
- 对不同角色的影响：  
  - **产品经理**：可以直接做原型验证想法，不必只靠写规范和排队  
  - **设计师**：可以在代码里迭代，而不只是在 Figma 里画图  
  - **工程师**：可以把更多时间从 “写实现” 转向 “做系统设计”  
- 作者判断很直接：**如果你不用编码代理，可能会被会用的人替代。**

---

## 6. 产品判断力变得更关键，差的想法会更浪费资源
- 好的产品经理或有产品感的人，会因为工具更强而创造更大价值。  
- 但反过来，**糟糕的产品判断也会更快地产生一堆无用原型**。  
- 这些糟糕原型会带来两种成本：  
  1. **占用评审资源**  
  2. 因为 “都做出来了”，更容易被硬推进上线，导致产品臃肿、变差  

**热门回复里一句话总结得很好：**  
> “现在最稀有的技能，是知道什么不该构建。”

这句话点出了重点：**生成能力不稀缺，判断能力才稀缺。**

---

## 7. 系统思维成为最核心的差异化能力
- 在 “做东西很便宜” 的时代，真正拉开差距的是：**你是否知道该怎么设计系统、判断问题、评估质量**。  
- 三类系统思维分别体现在：  
  - **工程**：服务、API、数据库如何搭得好  
  - **产品**：用户真正需要什么，而不是嘴上说要什么  
  - **设计**：为什么这个界面看起来和用起来都合理  
- 文章认为，系统思维的重要性并不是新出现的，而是因为**实现成本下降后，它的重要性被放大了**。  

**简单理解：**  
以前难点是 “做出来”；现在更难的是**“一开始就做对” 以及 “事后看得出好坏”**。

---

## 8. 每个人都需要 “产品感”
- 编码代理需要人来下指令，所以**你必须知道该让它做什么**。  
- 如果方向错了，只会制造更多垃圾原型，让团队评审负担更重。  
- 因此，不只是产品经理，**工程师和设计师也都需要产品意识**。  
- 有产品感的人，沟通和评审效率会更高：  
  - 不需要非常厚的文档  
  - 用精简说明就能让别人理解意图  
  - 可以更快推进交付

**一句话：**  
未来不是 “只有产品管产品”，而是**所有人都要具备基本产品判断力**。

---

## 9. 专业化不会消失，但门槛更高了
- 文章并不认为专业岗位会消失。  
  - 只专注系统架构的资深工程师仍然重要  
  - 对客户问题理解特别深的 PM 仍然重要  
  - 擅长用户旅程和交互设计的设计师仍然重要  
- 但问题是：**只会单点技能，已经不够了**。  
- 未来的专业人才还必须具备：  
  - 会用编码代理  
  - 评审速度快  
  - 沟通能力强  
  - 跨领域基本理解  
- 所以，**专业化还在，但入场标准明显提高，岗位数量也可能更少。**

---

## 10. 未来角色会向 “两类人” 收敛：构建者和评审者
文章把未来 EPD 角色简化成两大类：

### A. 构建者
- 有不错的产品思维  
- 会用编码代理  
- 有基本设计直觉  
- 能在测试、组件库等 “护栏” 下，把小功能快速从想法做成产品，把大功能做成可运行原型

### B. 评审者
- 主要负责大型、复杂功能的高质量审查  
- 必须是本领域的**强系统思考者**  
- 还要能高频、高速评审，因为待评审内容会很多

**对不同岗位的建议：**
- **工程师**：要么成为系统设计 / 架构评审高手，要么补产品和设计能力，转向构建者  
- **产品 / 设计**：要么成为高水平判断与评审者，要么深入使用编码代理，提升 “做出来” 的能力

---

## 11. 为什么每个角色都觉得自己最受益？因为可能都是真的
- 文章最后引用了一条很受欢迎的观点：  
  **最受益的人，是那些既懂现有产品哪里好坏、又懂技术可能性、还能理解真实文化趋势的人。**  
- 这种人通常站在**文化理解 + 深度技术**的交叉点上。  
- 有意思的是，产品、设计、工程、创始人都觉得这说的是自己。  
- 作者认为，他们**可能都没错**。因为在这个新世界里，**背景出身没那么重要了，关键是你是否能跨界整合判断、技术和执行**。  
- 但作者也提醒：这种 “全能型人才” 仍然稀缺，真正的 “独角兽” 并不多。

---

## 总结一句
**编码代理并没有让工程、产品、设计变得不重要；恰恰相反，它让 “判断、系统思维、产品感、评审能力和跨界协作” 变得比单纯执行更重要。**  
未来最有竞争力的人，不只是 “会做的人”，而是**知道该做什么、能快速做出来、还能判断好坏的人**。

# 总结

这篇文章的核心观点是：

- **编码智能体（Coding Agents）让 “写代码” 变得很便宜**
- 因此，软件团队里**工程、产品、设计（EPD）**的分工方式正在改变
- 过去的流程是：**PRD → 设计稿 → 工程实现**
- 现在更像是：**想法 / 原型先快速做出来 → 再重点评审**
- 所以，团队的瓶颈从 “怎么做出来”，转向了 “怎么判断它值不值得做、做得好不好”

作者进一步认为：

- **传统 PRD 流程正在过时**，但 “说明需求和意图的文档” 依然重要
- **通才**会越来越吃香，因为能跨产品、设计、工程快速推进
- **会用 Coding Agents 会变成基本要求**
- **产品判断力、系统思维、评审能力**会比单纯执行更重要
- 未来团队里的人，可能会逐渐分成两类：  
  **Builder（构建者）**和**Reviewer（评审者）**

# 解读

## 1. 为什么说 “PRD 已死”？

这里不是说 “文档没用了”，而是说：

> 以前那种 “先写很长的需求文档，再交给设计，再交给工程开发” 的线性流程，正在失效。

原因很简单：  
**现在做出一个可运行原型太容易了。**

过去，做软件很贵，所以要先把需求想清楚、写清楚，减少返工。  
现在，借助 AI，很多人可以先把东西 “做出来看看”。

所以变化不是 “不要需求”，而是：

- 以前：**先写文档，再做东西**
- 现在：**先做原型，再用文档解释意图**

这其实更接近 “边做边想、边看边改”。

---

## 2. 真正的瓶颈，变成了 “评审”

AI 能很快生成代码，但它不保证：

- 架构合理
- 性能可靠
- 体验顺手
- 真正解决用户问题

所以难点不再是 “能不能做出来”，而是：

- 这东西该不该做？
- 做法是否靠谱？
- 体验是否足够好？
- 能不能上线、能不能维护？

也就是说，**生成代码越来越便宜，但做判断越来越值钱。**

这会导致一个现实问题：  
团队里会冒出更多原型、更多半成品、更多 “看起来能用” 的东西，大家的时间会被大量评审占满。

---

## 3. 为什么通才更值钱？

因为沟通成本高。

如果一个人同时具备：

- 一点产品判断
- 一点设计感觉
- 一点工程能力
- 再加上会用 Coding Agents

那他就能很快把一个想法从 0 推到原型，甚至推到上线。

以前这种人也很强，但实现成本高，还是要大量依赖别人。  
现在有 AI 帮忙补执行，**通才的放大效应会更强**。

说白了：

> 以前通才卡在 “做不动”，现在通才可能直接 “一个人带飞”。

---

## 4. 为什么 “好 PM 更好，差 PM 更糟”？

因为坏想法现在也能很快被做出来。

以前一个糟糕需求可能死在文档阶段；  
现在它可能直接变成一个 “像模像样的原型”。

问题在于，这类原型会制造：

- 评审负担
- 决策干扰
- 上线冲动
- 产品膨胀

尤其是那种 “都做出来了，不如合进去吧” 的心态，很危险。

所以未来真正拉开差距的，不是 “能不能提需求”，而是：

- 是否理解用户真实问题
- 是否知道什么不该做
- 是否有清晰的产品边界感

---

## 5. 为什么每个人都需要 “产品感”？

因为 AI 只能按你的指令做事。

如果你自己不知道：

- 用户真正需要什么
- 目标是什么
- 这功能为什么存在

那你让 AI 生成得越快，可能只是越快地产生垃圾。

所以 “产品感” 不再只是 PM 的能力，而是所有人都需要的基础能力。  
工程师、设计师也要知道：

- 这个功能解决什么问题
- 用户会怎么用
- 什么才叫做好

这样你才能：

- 给 AI 更准确的指令
- 更快判断原型好不好
- 减少无效工作

---

## 6. “Builder / Reviewer” 这个划分很有意思

作者认为未来角色会更像两类：

### Builder（构建者）
能借助 AI 快速把想法做出来的人。

特点：

- 有基本产品判断
- 会用 Coding Agents
- 有基础设计和工程意识
- 能快速试错、推进小功能

### Reviewer（评审者）
负责把关复杂问题的人。

特点：

- 系统思维强
- 在某个领域很深
- 能高效评估质量、风险、方向
- 能决定 “能不能上线、该怎么改”

这其实说明：

> 未来最值钱的，不只是 “做的人”，也是 “能判断的人”。

---

# 我的意见

我基本同意这篇文章的大方向，但有三点补充：

## 1. “PRD 已死” 说得有点绝对
传统长文档、瀑布式 PRD 确实会变少，  
但在复杂系统、多人协作、强合规场景里，**文档依然不可替代**。

更准确地说：

- **老式 PRD 流程在弱化**
- **轻量、结构化、可追踪的需求说明在增强**

未来文档不会消失，只会变得更短、更活、更贴近原型。

---

## 2. AI 提高了速度，也放大了管理问题
原型变多，不一定等于好产品变多。  
如果团队缺少评审机制、质量标准、优先级纪律，AI 只会让混乱来得更快。

所以企业真正需要补的，不只是 “让大家用 AI”，而是：

- 评审机制
- 质量标准
- 权限边界
- 上线流程
- 知识沉淀

---

## 3. 最终拼的还是 “判断力”
工具会越来越强，门槛会越来越低。  
但真正稀缺的，始终是：

- 判断做什么
- 判断不做什么
- 判断什么是好
- 判断怎么长期演进

所以对个人来说，最值得投入的不是只学会 “怎么让 AI 写代码”，  
而是提升这三种能力：

- **产品判断力**
- **系统思维**
- **跨角色沟通能力**

---

# 一句话结论

**AI 正在把软件开发从 “重实现” 推向 “重判断、重评审、重协同”；未来更吃香的，不只是会做的人，而是知道该做什么、怎么把关的人。**

---
