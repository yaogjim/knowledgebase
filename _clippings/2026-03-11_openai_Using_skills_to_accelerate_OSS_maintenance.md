# Using skills to accelerate OSS maintenance

[API Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/login)

![Using skills to accelerate OSS maintenance](/images/blog/skills-agents-sdk.png)

We use Codex to change how we maintain the [OpenAI Agents SDK](/api/docs/guides/agents-sdk) repos. Repo-local skills, `AGENTS.md`, and GitHub Actions let us turn recurring engineering work, such as verification, release preparation, integration testing for examples, and PR review, into repeatable workflows. Even with a fairly simple setup, this has helped us increase development throughput in these active repos. Between December 1, 2025 and February 28, 2026, the two repos merged 457 PRs, up from 316 in the previous three months from September 1, 2025 through November 30, 2025 (Python: 182 -> 226, TypeScript: 134 -> 231).

For quick background, the SDK is available in [Python](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-js). It provides the core pieces for building agentic applications and is also a concise way to build voice agents on top of the [Realtime API](/api/docs/guides/realtime) with multiple agents, tools, and human-in-the-loop controls. It is used at significant scale: in recent 30-day windows as of March 6, 2026, the Python package saw about 14.7 million downloads on PyPI, and the TypeScript package saw about 1.5 million downloads on npm.

The setup is simple:

- repository policy in [`AGENTS.md`](https://agents.md/)
- repo-local skills in `.agents/skills/`
- optional scripts and references inside those skills
- [Codex GitHub Action](/codex/github-action) when the same workflow should run in CI

This setup gives Codex stable context about how the repository works, which improves the speed and accuracy of recurring engineering work.

If you maintain a public open-source project, see [Codex for Open Source](/codex/community/codex-for-oss). Eligible maintainers can apply for ChatGPT Pro with Codex, API credits, and conditional access to Codex Security.

## Keep workflows in the repo

In these repos, we use skills to capture repository-specific workflows. A skill is a small package of operational knowledge: a `SKILL.md` manifest, plus optional `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`. The [Codex customization docs](/codex/concepts/customization#skills) describe why this works well: skills are a good fit for repeatable workflows because they can carry richer instructions, scripts, and references without bloating the agent’s context up front.

This matches the progressive-disclosure model used by skills:

- it sees metadata such as `name` and `description` first
- it loads `SKILL.md` only when the skill is selected
- it reads references or runs scripts only when needed

Both SDK repos keep these workflows close to the code:

- [.agents/skills in openai-agents-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/tree/main/.agents/skills)
- [.agents/skills in openai-agents-js](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-js/tree/main/.agents/skills)

The Python repo is the simpler baseline:

- `code-change-verification` runs the required formatting, lint, type-checking, and test stack when code or build behavior changes.
- `docs-sync` audits the docs against the codebase and finds missing, incorrect, or outdated documentation.
- `examples-auto-run` runs examples in auto mode with logs and rerun helpers.
- `final-release-review` compares the previous release tag with the current release candidate and checks release readiness.
- `implementation-strategy` decides the compatibility boundary and implementation approach before editing runtime or API changes.
- `openai-knowledge` pulls current OpenAI API and platform docs through the official Docs MCP workflow.
- `pr-draft-summary` prepares the branch name suggestion, PR title, and draft description at handoff time.
- `test-coverage-improver` runs coverage, finds the biggest gaps, and proposes high-impact tests.

The JavaScript repo follows the same general pattern, then adds a few repo-specific skills for its npm monorepo and release process:

- `changeset-validation` checks that changesets and bump levels actually match the package diff.
- `integration-tests` publishes packages to a local Verdaccio registry and verifies install-and-run behavior across supported runtimes.
- `pnpm-upgrade` updates the pnpm toolchain and CI pins in a coordinated way.

What matters more than the exact list is the pattern. Each skill has a narrow contract, a clear trigger, and a concrete output.

Some of the most useful skills are not hard gates. `docs-sync` and `test-coverage-improver` are report-first workflows: they inspect the current diff or coverage artifacts, prioritize what matters, and ask for approval before making edits. In the Python repo, `docs-sync` also treats source docstrings and comments as the source of truth for generated reference docs instead of patching generated output by hand. The JavaScript-only `pnpm-upgrade` skill is another good example of a narrow maintenance workflow: it updates the local pnpm version, `packageManager`, and workflow pins together instead of falling back to broad search-and-replace.

## Make workflows mandatory

Skills become more useful when the repository requires them at the right time. That is where `AGENTS.md` comes in.

The [AGENTS.md guide](/codex/guides/agents-md#layer-project-instructions) describes these files as repository-level instructions that travel with the codebase and apply before the agent starts work. It also recommends keeping them small. In the Agents SDK repos, we use that space for the rules Codex should follow every time, and we put the highest-value ones near the top.

In practice, both repos use short if/then rules for mandatory skill usage. Before editing runtime or API changes, call `$implementation-strategy` to decide the compatibility boundary and implementation approach first. If the change affects SDK code, tests, examples, or build behavior, call `$code-change-verification`. If a JavaScript package change affects release metadata, call `$changeset-validation`. If the work touches OpenAI API or platform integrations, call `$openai-knowledge`. When the work is finished and ready to hand off, call `$pr-draft-summary`.

That structure also lines up with the [agents.md](https://agents.md/) recommendations: keep the project overview, build and test commands, code style, testing guidance, security considerations, and other repo-specific rules in one place. The Agents SDK repos follow that shape, but they lead with the operational triggers that matter most in day-to-day work. A compact version looks like this:

```md
# AGENTS.md

## Project overview

- Core SDK code lives under `src/agents/` or `packages/*/src/`.

- Tests live under `tests/` or `packages/*/test/`.

- Sample apps and integration surfaces live under `examples/`.

## Mandatory skill usage

- Use `$implementation-strategy` before editing runtime or API changes that may affect compatibility boundaries.

- Run `$code-change-verification` when runtime code, tests, examples, or build/test behavior changes.

- Use `$openai-knowledge` for OpenAI API or platform work.

- Use `$pr-draft-summary` when substantial code work is ready for review.

## Build and test commands

- Python: `make format`, `make lint`, `make typecheck`, `make tests`

- TypeScript: `pnpm i`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm -r build-check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`

## Compatibility rules

- Preserve positional compatibility for public constructors and dataclass fields.
```

The real files then add repo-specific details on top of that baseline, such as `$changeset-validation` in the JavaScript repo and the more detailed runtime, docs, and release guidance in both files. If you want full examples, see [AGENTS.md in openai-agents-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/AGENTS.md) and [AGENTS.md in openai-agents-js](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-js/blob/main/AGENTS.md).

`AGENTS.md` is not only for skill triggers. The Python repo also records a public API compatibility rule there: preserve the positional meaning of exported constructor parameters and dataclass fields, append new optional ones at the end when possible, and add compatibility tests if reordering is unavoidable. That is another good pattern: keep release-critical compatibility rules in the same place as the skill triggers.

### Verification rules

One clear example is `$code-change-verification`.

In both repos, the rule is not “always run a long validation stack.” The rule is “run it when runtime code, tests, examples, or build/test behavior changed, and do not mark the work complete until it passes.”

The conditional part keeps docs-only work lightweight. The mandatory part ensures that SDK code changes go through the repository’s standard verification steps.

The actual verification stacks are encoded in the skills themselves.

In the Python repo, it requires:

```bash
make format

make lint

make typecheck

make tests
```

In the JavaScript repo, the skill requires this exact order:

```bash
pnpm i

pnpm build

pnpm -r build-check

pnpm -r -F "@openai/*" dist:check

pnpm lint

pnpm test
```

The skill encodes the repository’s definition of “verified,” and `AGENTS.md` makes that definition enforceable.

### Changeset validation

The JavaScript repo has one more mandatory step for package changes: `$changeset-validation`, built around [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

When anything under `packages/` changes, or when `.changeset/` changes, the model has to do more than just run tests. It has to create or update the right changeset, validate the bump level, and confirm that the changeset actually matches the diff.

This skill does more than check that a file exists. It asks Codex to judge the git diff, and it keeps the validation rules in a shared prompt so local runs and GitHub Actions use the same logic. It also encodes repo-specific policy, such as:

- use the existing branch changeset instead of creating another one when one already exists
- keep the summary to one line in Conventional Commit style so it can double as a commit title
- before 1.0, avoid major bumps for normal feature work, and treat explicitly labeled preview-only additions as patch changes if they do not change existing behavior
- validate the required bump level against the actual package changes

That makes Codex responsible for validating the release metadata it creates before it can say the work is done.

### Use current docs

Both repos also require `$openai-knowledge` when work touches OpenAI API or platform integrations.

That skill is a thin wrapper around the official [OpenAI Docs MCP](https://developers.openai.com/resources/docs-mcp). Instead of letting the model answer from memory, it tells Codex to use the OpenAI Developer Documentation MCP server to look up the current docs for surfaces such as the Responses API, tools, streaming, Realtime, and MCP.

If the MCP server is not already configured in the local Codex environment, the skill points maintainers to the [Docs MCP quickstart](https://developers.openai.com/resources/docs-mcp#quickstart) and the [official MCP server endpoint](https://developers.openai.com/mcp).

### Prepare the PR handoff

At the end of substantive work, both repos use `$pr-draft-summary`.

That skill triggers only when the task is effectively finished or ready for review and the change touched meaningful code, tests, examples, docs with behavior impact, or build/test configuration. It then collects the branch name, working tree status, changed files, diff stats, and recent commits automatically, and produces:

- a branch name suggestion
- a PR title
- a draft PR description

The output format is intentionally rigid. A typical result looks like this:

```md
# Pull Request Draft

## Branch name suggestion

git checkout -b fix/tracing-lazy-init-fork-safety

## Title

fix: #2489 lazily initialize tracing globals to avoid import-time fork hazards

## Description

This pull request fixes import-time tracing side effects that could break fork-based process models by moving tracing bootstrap to lazy, first-use initialization.

It updates tracing setup so initialization happens once on first access while preserving the existing public tracing APIs.

It also adds regression tests for import-time behavior, one-time bootstrap, and custom provider handling.

This pull request resolves #2489.
```

Once you trust the model to validate and summarize its own work, asking it to produce the PR draft is a natural last step. It keeps the handoff consistent and reduces repetitive writing after the coding work is already complete.

## Write better descriptions

The `description` field in a skill’s `SKILL.md` frontmatter is part of the routing contract.

This is structural, not stylistic. The [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification) makes `name` and `description` the required `SKILL.md` frontmatter fields, and its progressive-disclosure model says those fields are what get loaded at startup for all skills. The full `SKILL.md` body and any `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/` are loaded only later, when the skill is actually activated.

The [Codex skills docs](/codex/skills) and [customization docs](/codex/concepts/customization#skills) describe the same behavior from the Codex side: Codex starts with each skill’s metadata for discovery, loads `SKILL.md` only when it chooses the skill, and reads references or runs scripts only when needed. The [Skills in OpenAI API cookbook](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/skills_in_api/#what-is-a-skill) describes the hosted-shell side just as explicitly: OpenAI reads each skill’s `name`, `description`, and path first, and the model uses that information to decide when to read the full `SKILL.md`. Its [SKILL.md frontmatter section](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/skills_in_api/#skillmd-frontmatter) makes the same point more directly: `name` and `description` are important for discovery and routing.

In the Agents SDK repos, that makes `description` one of the main routing signals before Codex has read the rest of the skill.

Here is a concrete example from `code-change-verification`.

Too vague:

```yaml
description: Run the mandatory verification stack in the OpenAI Agents JS monorepo.
```

Better (the actual description):

```yaml
description: Run the mandatory verification stack when changes affect runtime code, tests, or build/test behavior in the OpenAI Agents JS monorepo.
```

The shorter version already tells Codex what the skill does, but it still does not say when the skill applies, what kinds of changes should trigger it, or whether the checks are optional. The more specific version tells the model all three.

The same pattern shows up in `pr-draft-summary`.

Too vague:

```yaml
description: Create a PR title and draft description for a pull request.
```

Better (the actual description):

```yaml
description: Create a PR title and draft description after substantive code changes are finished. Trigger when wrapping up a moderate-or-larger change (runtime code, tests, build config, docs with behavior impact) and you need the PR-ready summary block with change summary plus PR draft text.
```

Again, the real description is routing metadata. It tells Codex:

- this is an end-of-task skill
- it is for substantive changes, not every chat turn
- the output is a PR-ready block, not just a prose summary

One practical lesson from these repos is to spend time on `description`. If routing feels unreliable, fix the metadata before you add more code.

## Put mechanics in scripts

After that, the next question is what belongs in the model and what should be pushed down into a script.

A reliable split is:

- interpretation, comparison, and reporting stay with the model
- deterministic, repeated shell work goes in `scripts/`

This matches the public guidance. The [Codex customization docs](/codex/concepts/customization#skills) describe skills as a way to give Codex richer instructions, scripts, and references for repeatable workflows without bloating context up front. That fits a model-first setup: let Codex handle the context-dependent parts of the job, and bring in scripts for the deterministic parts only when needed. The [Skills in OpenAI API cookbook](https://developers.openai.com/cookbook/examples/skills_in_api/#operational-best-practices) also recommends designing skill scripts like tiny CLIs: scripts that run from the command line, print deterministic stdout, fail loudly with usage or error messages, and write outputs to known file paths when needed.

In the Agents SDK repos, we try to use the model where its intelligence is actually useful, for example:

- reading source code to infer intended behavior
- comparing logs with that intended behavior
- deciding whether a release diff contains a real compatibility risk
- producing an explanation that a maintainer can act on

Scripts then handle the mechanics around that work, for example:

- running the repository’s required verification commands in a fixed order
- starting example runs, collecting per-example logs, and writing rerun files for failures
- fetching the previous release tag before a release-readiness review
- exposing helper commands such as `start`, `stop`, `status`, `logs`, `tail`, `collect`, and `rerun` so the same workflow is easy to run repeatedly

If the model has to rediscover the same shell recipe every time, that is usually a sign that the recipe should be a script. If the task depends on context, tradeoffs, or explanation, that part should stay with the model.

## Automate integration tests

One of the most useful workflow areas in both repos is automated integration testing. There are two related layers here: validating in-repo examples automatically in both repos, and, in the JavaScript repo, separately validating that published packages still work when installed the way users consume them.

Before this setup, validating examples was partly manual. You could run the examples, but the last mile often depended on visually checking logs or deciding by inspection whether the output looked right. That is manageable for one example. It does not scale well across a growing SDK repository.

The first layer is `examples-auto-run`, but the skill came after the runner. To automate example validation at all, we first had to build the underlying support for non-interactive example execution in both repos. That meant making it possible to run example scripts in an auto mode, including examples that normally involve prompts or approvals.

That groundwork included:

- auto-answering common interactive prompts
- auto-approving HITL, MCP, `apply_patch`, and shell actions where the runner supports them
- keeping examples that are still not suitable for automation on an auto-skip list, such as realtime or Next.js app examples that need extra runtime setup
- writing structured logs for each example run
- generating rerun files so failures can be retried without rerunning everything

Once that foundation was in place, we organized it as a skill so the workflow became reusable and easy to invoke. In the Python repo, `examples-auto-run` wraps `uv run examples/run_examples.py --auto-mode --write-rerun --main-log ... --logs-dir ...`. In the JavaScript repo, it wraps the build checks and then runs `pnpm examples:start-all` in auto mode with per-example logging and rerun support.

To improve validation quality, the runner’s job is to execute the examples and preserve their stdout and stderr in per-example logs. The skill then has Codex go through those logs one by one and compare them with the source code:

- read the example source and comments
- infer the intended flow
- open the matching log
- compare intended behavior with actual stdout and stderr
- do that for every successful example, not just one sample

This is more accurate and more flexible than trying to encode correctness as a fixed script-level assertion. A successful exit code is useful, but it is not enough for examples that talk to real APIs, use tools, or produce structured output. By recording the actual output first and then checking it carefully against the source code, we can validate each example according to its real intent.

In the JavaScript repo, there is then a second layer: the separate `integration-tests` skill. That workflow goes beyond running source examples in-place. It publishes the packages to a local Verdaccio registry and tests installing and running them in multiple environments, including Node.js, Bun, Deno, Cloudflare Workers, and a Vite React app. This catches a different class of problems: not “does the example run in the repo?” but “does the package still behave correctly after publish, install, and runtime integration?”

Taken together, these workflows show why it is useful to combine skills, scripts, and model judgment. The scripts make the runs repeatable, capture the evidence, and cover installation paths that are tedious to check by hand. Codex then uses that evidence to do a more careful comparison than a simple scripted pass/fail check.

## Add release checks

Release preparation is another area where this pattern helps.

The release-review workflow in both repos starts by finding the previous release tag, diffing it against the latest `main`, and then asking Codex to inspect that diff for:

- backward compatibility issues in public APIs and user-facing SDK behavior
- regressions, including smaller changes in expected behavior
- missing migration notes or release-note updates for changes that need them

Based on those findings, the skill makes an overall release-readiness call.

A concrete example is [openai/openai-agents-python#2480](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/pull/2480), where the release review stays green overall while still calling out the Python 3.9 drop and the release-note follow-up it requires:

```md
Release readiness review (excerpt)

Release call:

🟢 GREEN LIGHT TO SHIP. Minor-version bump includes expected breaking change

(Python 3.9 drop) with no concrete regressions found.

Scope summary:

- 38 files changed (+1450/-789); key areas touched: `src/agents/tool.py`,

  `src/agents/extensions/`, `src/agents/realtime/`, `tests/`,

  `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`.

Python 3.9 support removed

- Risk: 🟡 MODERATE. Users pinned to Python 3.9 will be unable to install the

  0.9.0 release.

- Evidence: `pyproject.toml` now sets `requires-python = ">=3.10"` and drops

  the Python 3.9 classifier; CI skip logic for 3.9 was removed.

- Action: Ensure release notes clearly call out the Python 3.9 drop and that

  packaging metadata remains `>=3.10`.
```

The skill also defines how the gate decision is made. The review starts from “safe to release” and switches to a blocked call only when the diff shows concrete evidence of a real problem. Every blocked call must come with a specific unblock checklist. That makes the output much easier to use: a green result means no release-blocking issue was found in the diff, and a blocked result means there is a real issue with a clear next step.

This is more useful than a generic “please review the release.” It forces the model to reason over a concrete diff and explain the result in operational terms. If the release is safe, say so. If it is not, point at the exact evidence and the exact follow-up needed.

## Run workflows in CI

Once a skill is useful locally, [Codex GitHub Action](/codex/github-action) makes it easy to automate the same workflow in CI. That works best when the local workflow is already stable, because manual use is where you debug the instructions, refine the scripts, and find the real edge cases.

For public repositories, the trigger design matters as much as the skill. The [GitHub Action security checklist](/codex/github-action#security-checklist) recommends limiting who can start the workflow, preferring trusted events or explicit approvals, sanitizing prompt inputs from PRs, commits, issues, or comments, keeping `OPENAI_API_KEY` protected with `drop-sudo` or an unprivileged user, and running Codex as the last step in the job.

If a workflow is write-capable and takes untrusted public input, the risk is usually in the trigger design, input handling, and runtime privileges around the skill.

## Use Codex in PR review

Skills are one part of the productivity story in these repos. [Codex GitHub PR auto review](/codex/integrations/github) is another.

Since Codex GitHub PR auto review became available, Codex has been a useful reviewer across most code changes in these repos. We use it as a regular part of review, not as a special-case tool.

For straightforward program bugs, regressions, and missing tests, relying on Codex as the required review path is now safe enough in practice. It is consistent at checking the same correctness patterns over and over, and it has removed a major bottleneck for small fixes and routine improvements.

Peer review is still important, but for a different class of changes.

Human review is still essential when the main question is not “is this code correct?” but “which of several valid options should we choose, and how should we ship it?” That includes:

- API or architecture changes where there are multiple reasonable designs and maintainers need to make an explicit choice
- behavior changes that affect product expectations, backward-compatibility promises, or rollout policy
- naming, migration, and release-communication decisions where the hard part is choosing what will be clearest for users and contributors
- changes that require alignment across maintainers or teams, such as scoping work, sequencing it, or deciding what should ship now versus later

Codex can still contribute usefully in all of those cases, but they still benefit from a human decision-maker and direct discussion.

`AGENTS.md` can also encode that split: the repo can tell Codex what counts as important for correctness review, and Codex can apply that guidance consistently.

This has also been a significant contributor to throughput. Repetitive review and validation work no longer waits on scarce reviewer time for every low-risk change, while maintainers can stay focused on higher-context review where their judgment matters most. That shift has helped us move through backlog bugs and smaller feature improvements much faster.

## Final thoughts

In the OpenAI Agents SDK repos, skills work best when they are part of the repository’s normal working setup.

`AGENTS.md` tells Codex which workflows are required. `description` tells it when to route into those workflows. `scripts/` handles the deterministic parts. The model handles the contextual parts. And once a workflow is solid locally, [Codex GitHub Action](/codex/github-action) can carry the same process into CI.

That has made everyday engineering work in these repos more explicit and more reliable. It has also made it easier to ship small improvements faster, because verification, release review, and PR handoff now follow the same repeatable process.

## 💬 对话记录

### 📋 提示词模板: 结构化

> *(已省略完整内容)*

### 🤖 AI

这篇文章的核心意思是：**把开源项目里反复出现的维护工作，做成 “可复用的技能（skills）+ 仓库规则（AGENTS.md）+ GitHub Actions” 工作流，可以明显提升维护效率。**  
OpenAI 在维护 Agents SDK 的 Python 和 TypeScript 仓库时，用这套方法让 PR 合并量在 3 个月内明显增长。

---

## 1. 背景：为什么要这样做

- OpenAI 用 Codex 来维护**OpenAI Agents SDK**的两个开源仓库：Python 版和 TypeScript 版。
- 这些仓库很活跃，且使用规模大：
  - 截至**2026 年 3 月 6 日**前 30 天，
    - Python 包在**PyPI 约 1470 万次下载**
    - TypeScript 包在**npm 约 150 万次下载**
- 使用这套方法后，维护效率提升明显：
  - **2025/12/1 - 2026/2/28**共合并**457 个 PR**
  - 上一阶段**2025/9/1 - 2025/11/30**为**316 个 PR**
  - 分仓库看：
    - Python：**182 → 226**
    - TypeScript：**134 → 231**

**一句话理解：**它不是单纯 “让 AI 写代码”，而是让 AI 按固定流程做验证、发版检查、PR 整理等重复工作。

---

## 2. 整体方案：核心由三部分组成

文章给出的做法很简单，主要包括：

- **AGENTS.md**：写清楚仓库级规则和何时必须调用某个技能
- **.agents/skills/**：把具体维护流程封装成 skills
- **GitHub Actions**：把需要在 CI 中重复执行的流程自动化

这样做的好处是：

- 给 Codex 提供稳定、明确的仓库上下文
- 让重复性工程任务变成标准化流程
- 提高执行速度和准确性

---

## 3. Skills 是怎么设计的：把重复工作拆成小而清晰的流程

作者强调，**skill 本质上是一小包 “可执行的操作知识”**，通常包含：

- `SKILL.md`
- 可选的`scripts/`
- 可选的`references/`
- 可选的`assets/`

它采用 “按需加载” 的方式：

- 先看技能的**名称和描述**
- 选中后再加载`SKILL.md`
- 真需要时才读取参考资料或执行脚本

这能避免一开始把大量无关说明塞进上下文里。

### Python 仓库里的典型 skills

文章列了多个具体技能，例如：

- **code-change-verification**  
  当代码或构建行为变更时，执行格式化、lint、类型检查和测试
- **docs-sync**  
  检查文档和代码是否一致，找出缺失、错误、过期内容
- **examples-auto-run**  
  自动运行示例并记录日志
- **final-release-review**  
  对比上一个 release tag 和当前候选版本，检查是否能发布
- **implementation-strategy**  
  在改运行时 / API 前，先判断兼容性边界和实现方案
- **openai-knowledge**  
  调用官方文档源，获取最新 OpenAI API / 平台信息
- **pr-draft-summary**  
  任务结束时，自动生成分支名建议、PR 标题和描述
- **test-coverage-improver**  
  分析覆盖率缺口，提出高价值测试建议

### JavaScript 仓库的额外 skills

除了类似的通用技能外，JS 仓库还增加了 monorepo /npm 发布相关技能：

- **changeset-validation**  
  检查 changeset 是否和实际包改动匹配
- **integration-tests**  
  发布到本地 Verdaccio 仓库，验证安装和运行
- **pnpm-upgrade**  
  协调升级 pnpm 工具链和 CI 配置

### 作者强调的关键设计原则

与其记住所有技能，不如记住这个模式：

- 每个 skill 都要**职责窄**
- 要有**明确触发条件**
- 要有**具体输出结果**

例如：

- `docs-sync`和`test-coverage-improver`不是强制拦截型流程，而是 “**先出报告，再请求批准修改**”
- Python 的`docs-sync`还规定：**以源码中的 docstring 和注释为准**，而不是直接手改生成文档

---

## 4. AGENTS.md 的作用：把 “该什么时候用什么技能” 写成硬规则

文章认为，skill 只有在**正确时机被强制触发**时才真正有价值，这就是`AGENTS.md`的作用。

它是仓库级指令文件，应该简洁，但要放最重要的规则。  
在这两个 SDK 仓库里，主要使用**if/then 风格规则**，例如：

- 如果要改运行时或 API，先调用**`$implementation-strategy`**
- 如果变更影响 SDK 代码、测试、示例或构建行为，调用**`$code-change-verification`**
- 如果 JS 包变更影响发布元数据，调用**`$changeset-validation`**
- 如果涉及 OpenAI API 或平台集成，调用**`$openai-knowledge`**
- 工作完成准备交接时，调用**`$pr-draft-summary`**

此外，`AGENTS.md`还集中放项目关键规则，比如：

- 项目目录结构
- 构建和测试命令
- 代码风格
- 测试要求
- 安全注意事项
- 兼容性规则

### 具体兼容性规则案例

Python 仓库在`AGENTS.md`里记录了一个重要 API 兼容性要求：

- **导出构造函数参数和 dataclass 字段的位置含义要保持不变**
- 新的可选参数尽量追加在末尾
- 如果不得不重排参数，要补兼容性测试

这类规则非常关键，适合和技能触发条件放在同一个地方统一管理。

## 5. 验证流程怎么落地：不是 “每次都跑全量”，而是 “该跑时必须跑”

文章用`code-change-verification`举了一个清晰例子。

它的规则不是：

- “永远执行一大套冗长验证”

而是：

- **只有当运行时代码、测试、示例、构建 / 测试行为发生变化时才执行**
- **而且在验证通过前，不能把工作标记为完成**

这样设计的好处是：

- 文档类小改动不会被重流程拖慢
- 真正影响代码质量的改动一定会走标准验证

### 两个仓库的具体验证命令

**Python 仓库要求：**

- `make format`
- `make lint`
- `make typecheck`
- `make tests`

**JavaScript 仓库要求按这个顺序执行：**

- `pnpm i`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm -r build-check`
- `pnpm -r -F"@openai/*"dist:check`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm test`

也就是说：

- **skill 负责定义 “什么叫已验证”**
- **AGENTS.md 负责让这个定义可执行、可强制**

---

## 6. JS 仓库的发布校验：不仅检查有没有文件，还要判断 “改动和版本级别是否匹配”

JavaScript 仓库里还有一个重要强制步骤：**`changeset-validation`**。

当`packages/`或`.changeset/`发生变化时，不只是跑测试，还要：

- 创建或更新正确的 changeset
- 验证版本 bump 级别是否正确
- 确认 changeset 的内容是否真的匹配实际 diff

这个 skill 不只是检查 “文件存不存在”，而是让 Codex 去理解 git diff，并按统一规则判断。

### 文中给出的具体策略包括：

- 分支上已有 changeset 时，**优先复用，不再新建**
- summary 保持**单行、Conventional Commit 风格**
- **1.0 之前**，普通功能更新尽量**避免 major bump**
- 明确标记为 preview-only 的新增功能，如果不改变现有行为，可视为**patch**
- 最终要验证 bump 级别是否和实际包改动一致

**通俗说：**AI 不只是帮你写发布说明，还要对自己写的发布元数据负责。

---

## 7. 涉及 OpenAI 平台时，必须查 “当前文档”，不能只靠记忆

两个仓库都规定：如果工作涉及**OpenAI API 或平台集成**，必须调用**`$openai-knowledge`**。

这个 skill 本质上是对**官方 OpenAI Docs MCP**的轻量封装。  
目的很明确：

- 不让模型靠旧记忆回答
- 而是去查最新官方文档

它会检索的内容包括：

- Responses API
- tools
- streaming
- Realtime
- MCP

如果本地还没配置 MCP，skill 还会引导维护者去看 quickstart 和官方服务端地址。

## 8. 交付前自动整理 PR：减少最后的重复写作

在实质性工作结束后，两个仓库都会使用**`$pr-draft-summary`**。

它只在以下情况触发：

- 任务基本完成或可评审
- 改动涉及有意义的代码、测试、示例
- 或涉及会影响行为的文档、构建 / 测试配置

它会自动收集：

- 分支名
- 工作区状态
- 修改文件
- diff 统计
- 最近提交

然后生成三样东西：

- **建议分支名**
- **PR 标题**
- **PR 描述草稿**

### 文中示例

生成结果类似：

- 分支名建议：`fix/tracing-lazy-init-fork-safety`
- 标题：  
  `fix: #2489 lazily initialize tracing globals to avoid import-time fork hazards`
- 描述核心内容：  
  通过把 tracing 初始化改成 “首次使用时再懒加载”，避免导入阶段副作用破坏基于 fork 的进程模型，并补充回归测试。

作者的观点是：  
**既然模型已经能验证并总结自己的工作，那么顺手生成 PR 草稿就是很自然的最后一步。**

---

## 9. Skill 的 description 很重要：它决定模型会不会在正确时机用对技能

文章特别强调：`SKILL.md`里的**description 不是装饰性文案，而是路由信号**。

因为系统启动时，模型首先看到的往往只是：

- name
- description

而不是完整技能内容。

### 文中举的例子

以`code-change-verification`为例：

**差的写法：**

- “运行 OpenAI Agents JS monorepo 的强制验证栈”

**更好的写法：**

- “当改动影响运行时代码、测试或构建 / 测试行为时，运行强制验证栈”

后者更好，因为它明确了：

- 技能做什么
- 什么时候触发
- 是否是强制性的

`pr-draft-summary`也是一样。好的描述会告诉模型：

- 这是任务收尾时用的技能
- 适用于中等以上的重要改动
- 输出的是 “可直接用于 PR 的结构化内容”

**作者的经验总结：**  
如果技能路由不稳定，先优化 metadata，别急着加更多代码。

---

## 10. 该交给模型还是脚本：一个实用划分标准

文章最后给出一个很实用的原则：

### 适合交给模型的工作

- 解释和判断
- 比较差异
- 生成报告
- 理解代码意图

### 适合放进脚本的工作

- 确定性、重复性的 shell 操作
- 可以标准化的命令执行
- 需要稳定 stdout / 明确报错的步骤

也就是说：

- **“需要理解” 的部分交给模型**
- **“机械执行” 的部分交给脚本**

这样既能发挥模型的判断能力，也能保证流程稳定。

## 总结

文章想传达的重点很明确：  
**开源维护效率提升，不一定靠复杂系统，关键是把重复工作沉淀为 repo 内的 skills，并用 AGENTS.md 明确强制触发规则。**

它带来的实际效果包括：

- PR 合并量显著提升：**316 → 457**
- 验证、发布、文档同步、PR 交接等工作更一致
- AI 不再只是 “辅助写代码”，而是按仓库规范执行维护流程

**最值得借鉴的做法有三点：**

1. **把工作流写进仓库**
2. **用 AGENTS.md 明确 “什么时候必须执行什么”**
3. **让模型负责判断，让脚本负责机械执行**

### 📋 提示词模板: 产品-最佳实践

> *(已省略完整内容)*

### 🤖 AI

以下是基于你提供内容提炼出的**最佳实践（精炼版）**：

## 1. 把高频维护流程沉淀为 repo-local skills
将重复性的 OSS 维护工作（验证、发布检查、集成测试、PR 总结、文档同步等）封装为`.agents/skills/`下的技能，避免每次靠人工口述或临时判断。

## 2. 用 AGENTS.md 定义 “必须触发” 的规则
在仓库根目录用简短的**if/then**规则明确：
- 什么时候必须先做方案评估
- 什么时候必须跑验证
- 什么时候必须查官方文档
- 什么时候必须生成 PR handoff  
核心原则：**技能可选，触发规则必须清晰且稳定。**

## 3. 技能设计要 “小而专”
每个 skill 只做一件事，并具备：
- 明确触发条件
- 清晰输入范围
- 固定输出结果  
不要做 “大而全” 的万能技能，优先做窄职责、可复用的工作流。

## 4. 把 “仓库标准” 编码进 skill
例如验证 skill 中直接固化：
- 格式化
- lint
- type check
- test
- build/check 顺序  
这样 skill 就代表仓库对 “完成 / 通过” 的正式定义，而不是让模型自行猜测。

## 5. 条件化强制验证，而不是一刀切
不要要求所有改动都跑全量验证。  
最佳实践是：**仅当运行时代码、测试、示例、构建 / 测试行为变更时强制验证**；纯文档修改则保持轻量。

## 6. 把发布元数据校验也纳入工作流
对于 monorepo 或 npm/pypi 发布流程，不仅检查代码，还要校验：
- changeset 是否存在
- bump level 是否正确
- 发布说明是否匹配实际 diff  
即：**让模型对自己生成的发布元数据负责。**

## 7. 涉及平台 / API 集成时，强制查 “当前官方文档”
不要让模型凭记忆回答 OpenAI API 或平台集成问题。  
应通过统一 skill 接入官方文档源（如 Docs MCP），确保判断基于最新规范。

## 8. PR 收尾标准化
在任务完成或准备 review 时，统一触发 PR summary skill，自动生成：
- branch name 建议
- PR title
- draft PR description  
这能显著减少维护者在交接阶段的重复写作成本。

## 9. Skill description 要写 “用途 + 触发时机 + 输出”
`SKILL.md`的`description`不只是说明文字，而是**路由元数据**。  
好的 description 应明确：
- 这个 skill 做什么
- 何时触发
- 输出是什么  
如果技能调用不稳定，先优化 description，而不是先加复杂逻辑。

## 10. 模型负责判断，脚本负责机械执行
推荐职责划分：
- **模型**：解释、比较、归因、总结、给建议
- **脚本**：重复性 shell 操作、固定检查流程、生成确定性输出  
原则：**把确定性的机械步骤下沉到 scripts，把需要上下文理解的部分留给模型。**

## 11. 兼容性规则写进 AGENTS.md
像公共 API 参数顺序、dataclass 字段兼容性、发布前必须补兼容性测试等这类**发布级规则**，应与技能触发规则放在同一个中心位置，避免遗漏。

## 12. 本地工作流与 CI 保持一致
当某个 skill 已经足够稳定、且应成为团队标准时，同步接入 GitHub Actions。  
目标是：**本地与 CI 使用同一套规则和判断逻辑**，减少 “本地过、线上不过” 的偏差。

---

## 一句话总结
最佳实践不是 “给模型更多自由”，而是：  
**把 OSS 维护中的高频流程产品化为技能，用 AGENTS.md 强制关键触发点，再用脚本和 CI 固化可重复执行的标准。**
