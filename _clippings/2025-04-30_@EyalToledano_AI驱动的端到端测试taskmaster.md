meta af:

using ai to analyze ai e2e tests for each of the ai providers in taskmaster ðŸ¤¯

test executes the exact same command via different ai providers so the LLM has a full picture of output quality across providers

so now it can rank them for output accuracy

sonnet 3.7 ðŸ‘‘

Amazing. Would help a lot of apps including inbox zero.

conceptually this is working for me mostly because i'm testing in a CLI format (i'm consuming my own CLI)

this is a lot harder to do and i think basically requires browser use.

shortest is a really good example of that but the performance is not there and the cost is absurd

Project seems very interesting! Does it support any form of UML or other diagrams as source documentation too? I am struggling to keep the cursor in line to follow documentation.

You should be able to pass in mermaid code and it will understand yep.

I enjoy using playwright in Cursor to run e2e smoketests too
