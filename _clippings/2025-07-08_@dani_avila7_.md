Introducing Claude Code Templates ðŸš€

I originally built this to streamline how I set up new projects with Claude Codeâ€¦just a small tool to make my own workflow smoother.

No install, just run:

npx claude-code-templates

Right now, it configures Commands, Hooks, MCPs, and settings.json for JavaScript/TypeScript and Python projects.

It made things so much easier for me that I decided to share it with the community.

Open-source and open to ideas â€” feel free to contribute!

Big thanks to the team at @AnthropicAI and everyone behind @claude\_code ðŸ™Œ
