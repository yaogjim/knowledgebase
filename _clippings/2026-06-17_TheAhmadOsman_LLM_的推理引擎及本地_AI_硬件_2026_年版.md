# LLM 的推理引擎及本地 AI 硬件（2026 年版）

# LLM 的推理引擎及本地 AI 硬件（2026 年版）

> You don't pick an inference engine first. You pick a hardware strategy, a workload shape, and a serving model. The engine follows.

That is the most useful way to think about LLM inference engines.

Series note: This is Part 3 in my series teaching Self-hosted LLMs / Local AI.

- Part 1:
 
 [GPU Memory Math for LLMs (2026 Edition)](https://x.com/TheAhmadOsman/status/2040103488714068245).
 
- Part 2:
 
 [Memory Bandwidth for Local AI Hardware (2026 Edition)](https://x.com/TheAhmadOsman/status/2041331757329285589).
 

Those two pieces explain the hardware capacity and bandwidth math.

This one explains the software layer that turns that hardware into usable inference.

## Engines

These tools serve different purposes / occupy different layers

- Local portability
- Consumer CUDA
- Apple unified-memory workflows
- Quantized inference
- Production serving
- Distributed orchestration
- Vendor-optimized datacenter execution

A useful mental model:

The inference engine is not "the model." It is the traffic cop, memory manager, kernel dispatcher, scheduler, cache accountant, parallelism planner, API surface, and sometimes the deployment framework.

最佳引擎匹配您的内存层次结构、互联、量化格式、延迟和吞吐量目标、模型架构以及操作成熟度。

## The one-page decision guide

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HIySt_uXkAAL3dt?format=jpg&name=large)

- Laptop / edge / odd hardware → llama.cpp
- Mac-first workflows → MLX / MLX-LM
- 单 RTX 本地推理 → ExLlamaV2
- 2-4+ NVIDIA / CUDA GPUs → ExLlamaV3
- General production serving → vLLM
- Long-context / MoE / routing → SGLang
- NVIDIA max performance → TensorRT-LLM
- Cluster orchestration → NVIDIA Dynamo

The rest of this guide explains why.

## What an inference engine actually does

An inference engine loads weights, tokenizes input, runs the forward pass, samples tokens, maintains the KV cache, and streams results. Serious engines also handle batching, scheduling, prefix caching, quantization, parallel execution, API serving, metrics, and distributed execution.

The workload has two phases:

Prefill reads the prompt and builds the initial KV cache. It is compute-intensive.

Decode generates one token at a time, repeatedly reading weights and KV cache. It is memory-bandwidth-bound. Decode speed tracks memory bandwidth more than peak compute.

That distinction explains almost everything:

- Short prompt, long answer: decode dominates → memory bandwidth and batching matter.
- Long prompt, short answer: prefill dominates → attention kernels and chunked prefill matter.
- 许多用户：调度器质量很重要 → 连续批处理，缓存分页，公平性。
- Long context: KV cache dominates → paged attention, KV quantization, offload.
- MoE: 专家路由主导 → 专家并行、互联、分组 GEMMs
- 多节点: 互联主导 → NVLink、RDMA、流水线并行、解耦。

PagedAttention 解决了 KV 缓存碎片化问题。FlashAttention 使用 IO 感知分块来减少 HBM（高带宽内存）流量。推测解码生成廉价 token 并并行验证它们。反复出现的主题：推理性能是内存移动加上调度。

## The real bottlenecks

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HIySwctXUAAWvdU?format=jpg&name=large)

1\. Memory bandwidth, not just VRAM size. VRAM determines fit. Bandwidth determines decode speed. Apple's M3 Ultra offers up to 819 GB/s unified-memory bandwidth. NVIDIA's H100 SXM lists 3.35 TB/s GPU memory bandwidth. Unified memory lets you fit models that would not fit in consumer VRAM. HBM lets you serve them faster when the model fits. Fit is not speed. Capacity is not bandwidth.

2\. KV 缓存增长 KV 缓存的大小会随着批次大小和上下文长度而增长。即使权重能够适配，长上下文工作负载也可能耗尽内存。PagedAttention 将 KV 缓存划分为块，提高利用率并支持更大的批次。

3\. Interconnect. The moment a model crosses GPU boundaries (multi-GPUs), you pay communication cost. Tensor parallelism needs frequent all-reduce collectives. Pipeline parallelism communicates at stage boundaries. Expert parallelism needs all-to-all traffic for MoE. vLLM's docs note that without NVLink, pipeline parallelism can outperform tensor parallelism.

4\. Scheduler quality. A good scheduler decides which requests enter the batch, how prefill and decode share the accelerator, whether long prompts block short decodes, and how to avoid starvation. Supporting batching is not the same as behaving like a production-ready scheduler.

5\. 运行时开销。CUDA 图、内核融合、采样开销、分词器开销、HTTP 开销、LoRA 切换以及结构化解码都很重要。在大规模场景下，这些恼人的 2% 开销会形成合力，需要引起重视（并无双关之意）。

## The engine families

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HIySychWYAA9HOd?format=jpg&name=large)

There are four broad families:

Portable local runtimes: llama.cpp, MLC LLM, ONNX Runtime GenAI, OpenVINO, Ollama-style tools. These care about "make it run here."

Apple/unified-memory runtimes: MLX and MLX-LM. These care about "use big shared memory and Apple's stack well."

Consumer CUDA quant engines: ExLlamaV2 and ExLlamaV3. These care about "make my 3090/4090/5090 box scream with low-bit weights."

Production serving engines: vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM, TGI, LMDeploy. These care about concurrent users, KV cache, batching, parallelism, observability, and cost per token.

Then there are orchestration layers like Dynamo that sit above engines and coordinate fleets, disaggregated prefill/decode, routing, and autoscaling.

## llama.cpp: the portability king

llama.cpp is the answer when the hardware is weird, constrained, offline, CPU-heavy, edge-oriented, or not a tidy NVIDIA datacenter node.

It supports Apple Silicon via ARM NEON, Accelerate, and Metal; x86 via AVX/AVX2/AVX512/AMX; RISC-V; low-bit quantization; CUDA; AMD via HIP; MUSA; Vulkan; SYCL; and CPU+GPU hybrid offload. That is why llama.cpp owns the "just make it run" lane.

The HTTP server is more capable than a "toy local runner". llama-server provides OpenAI-compatible routes, Anthropic Messages API compatibility, reranking, continuous batching, multimodal support, JSON schema constraints, function calling, speculative decoding, and a web UI.

The critical limitation: llama.cpp is not for serious multi-node production serving. Its RPC backend is explicitly documented as proof-of-concept, fragile, and insecure.

Verdict: Use llama.cpp when portability, offline operation, GGUF, or hybrid offload matter more than fleet-scale serving.

DO NOT use with

[Multi-GPUs](https://www.ahmadosman.com/blog/do-not-use-llama-cpp-or-ollama-on-multi-gpus-setups-use-vllm-or-exllamav2/)

## MLX and MLX-LM: the Apple Silicon weapon

MLX is Apple's array framework for Apple Silicon, and MLX-LM is the LLM package built on it. It is a Mac-first ML stack.

The key hardware fact is unified memory. Apple Silicon gives the CPU and GPU direct access to the same memory pool. MLX arrays live in unified memory, and you choose the device when running the operation rather than moving arrays between separate memory spaces.

This changes the local inference tradeoff. On a discrete GPU system, the question is "does it fit in VRAM?" On an M-series Mac with large unified memory, the question becomes "does it fit in memory, and can the memory system feed the GPU fast enough?" Large quantized models can fit on machines where the same model would be impossible on a 24 GB consumer GPU.

However, it is also slower.

MLX-LM adds Hugging Face Hub integration, quantization, LoRA and full fine-tuning, distributed inference, and a large MLX Community model ecosystem. MLX is no longer Mac-only: it offers CUDA and CPU-only packages for Linux. Distributed communication supports MPI, Ring over TCP, JACCL for RDMA over Thunderbolt, and NCCL for CUDA.

MLX-LM's server itself warns that it is not recommended for production because it only implements basic security checks.

Verdict: Use MLX for Mac-first ML and LLM workflows. For high-concurrency public serving, start with a real serving stack.

## ExLlamaV2 and V3: consumer CUDA, tuned and fast

ExLlamaV2 是一个本地 CUDA 量化引擎，旨在让消费级 NVIDIA GPU 发挥超出其性能水平的作用。它支持分页注意力、动态批处理、提示词缓存、KV 缓存去重、批生成、流式处理和推测解码。要记住的关键词是“本地”。它能让量化模型在现代 CUDA GPU 上运行得更快，尤其是消费级显卡。

Best fits: one RTX 3090/4090/5090 box, local coding assistant, local chat, EXL2 quantized models, and prosumer workstation use.

ExLlamaV3 延续了面向多 GPU 和 MoE 本地推理的理念。它新增了基于 QTIP 的 EXL3 量化格式，为消费级硬件提供灵活的张量并行和专家并行推理，通过 TabbyAPI 提供一个 OpenAI 兼容的服务器，支持持续动态批处理和多模态功能。

V3 is compelling when you have 2-4+ consumer NVIDIA GPUs or want local MoE. Expect caveats: some models do not support tensor or expert parallelism in ExLlamaV3.

Verdict: ExLlamaV2 is the enthusiast's local CUDA engine. ExLlamaV3 is the frontier for multi-GPU (2-4) local setups. Expect rougher edges for better capability.

## vLLM: the default open-source production server

vLLM is the first engine most teams should evaluate for serious opensource LLM serving.

It offers PagedAttention-based KV memory management, continuous batching, chunked prefill, prefix caching, CUDA/HIP graphs, extensive quantization (FP8, MXFP8/MXFP4, NVFP4, INT8, INT4, GPTQ, AWQ, GGUF), optimized attention and GEMM/MoE kernels, speculative decoding, torch.compile, and disaggregated prefill/decode/encode.

It is also flexible: tensor/pipeline/data/expert/context parallelism, streaming, structured outputs, tool calling, OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic Messages APIs, gRPC, multi-LoRA, and support for NVIDIA, AMD, x86/ARM/PowerPC CPUs, plus plugins for TPUs, Gaudi, Ascend, Apple Silicon, and more.

vLLM's docs note that multi-node deployments typically use Ray, and without NVLink, pipeline parallelism may beat tensor parallelism. The trap is assuming vLLM removes the need for systems thinking. You still need to tune batching, context length, GPU memory utilization, parallelism layout, and routing. vLLM gives you a very good engine; it still requires good System Design.

Verdict: If someone says "we need to serve open models in production," vLLM is the default starting point.

## SGLang: vLLM's systems-brained cousin

SGLang is what you reach for when the serving workload is ugly: structured outputs, long context, MoE, disaggregation, and routing.

It offers RadixAttention prefix caching, prefill-decode disaggregation, speculative decoding, continuous batching, paged attention, tensor/pipeline/expert/data parallelism, structured outputs, chunked prefill, and multi-LoRA batching. It supports NVIDIA, AMD, Intel Xeon, Google TPUs, Ascend NPUs, and more.

SGLang's differentiator is serving architecture. Its prefill-decode disaggregation separates compute-intensive prefill from memory-intensive decode into specialized instances, transferring KV cache between them. This prevents long prefill batches from interrupting decode and spiking token latency.

Verdict: SGLang is for teams whose bottleneck is no longer "can we run the model?" but "can we run it under hostile traffic without torching latency, memory, and cost?"

## TensorRT-LLM: maximum NVIDIA performance

TensorRT-LLM is the NVIDIA-max-performance stack. It is optimized, specialized, powerful, and not pretending to be portable.

It provides Python APIs to build TensorRT engines with state-of-the-art optimizations, plus Python and C++ runtimes. It includes custom kernels for attention, GEMMs, and MoE; prefill-decode disaggregation, Wide Expert Parallelism, speculative decoding; and a high-level Python API integrated with NVIDIA Dynamo and Triton Inference Server.

B200 GPUs can load FP4 weights with optimized kernels. H100 and later support FP8 quantization that can double performance and halve memory consumption versus 16-bit with minimal accuracy loss.

Where it shines: H100/H200/B200/GB200/GB300-class fleets, NVIDIA-only datacenters, FP8/FP4 deployment, multi-node serving, and MoE at scale. Where it is awkward: AMD, Apple, or Intel portability; fast-changing experimental models; small local setups; and teams that need "works on everything."

Verdict: If you are committed to NVIDIA and care about absolute performance, TensorRT-LLM belongs in the bake-off. You trade portability for performance. Tuned specialization but less features.

## The rest of the field

TGI 是 Hugging Face 的生产服务器，具备跟踪、指标、张量并行和连续批处理功能。当需要 HF 集成和简洁性时使用它。

MLC LLM is the compiler-first universal deployment engine with OpenAI-compatible APIs across REST, Python, JavaScript, iOS, and Android. Best for "ship LLMs everywhere," especially browser, mobile, and native apps.

ONNX Runtime GenAI implements the full generative loop over ONNX Runtime and powers Foundry Local, Windows ML, and the VS Code AI Toolkit. It supports CPU, CUDA, DirectML, TensorRT-RTX, OpenVINO, QNN, WebGPU, and AMD GPU. Best for app deployment and ONNX workflows.

OpenVINO GenAI is the Intel-optimized story for Xeon CPUs, Arc GPUs, Core Ultra, and NPUs. It offers OpenAI-compatible serving with continuous batching and paged attention. Best for Intel hardware.

LMDeploy is a CUDA-focused toolkit with TurboMind for performance and PyTorch for accessibility. Most interesting for CUDA users who want an alternative to vLLM/SGLang/TensorRT-LLM.

NVIDIA Dynamo 是一个分布式编排层，位于 vLLM、SGLang 和 TensorRT-LLM 等引擎之上，支持解聚合、智能路由和多层 KV 缓存。当单引擎服务不再足够时使用它。

Note: DO NOT USE Ollama.

## Hardware strategy recipes

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HIyS3rPWoAAICxo?format=jpg&name=large)

仅 CPU 服务器: llama.cpp 优先。适用于 Intel Xeon 的 OpenVINO。适用于应用/ONNX 部署的 ONNX Runtime GenAI。

MacBook / Mac Studio：MLX / MLX-LM 用于 Mac 原生工作流。llama.cpp 用于 GGUF 可移植性。

单 RTX 3090 / 4090 / 5090: ExLlamaV2 用于 EXL2 本地推理。llama.cpp 用于 GGUF 或可移植性。若服务多用户则使用 vLLM。

双或四消费级 RTX 设备：ExLlamaV3 用于多 GPU 量化推理或混合专家模型（MoE）。如果服务行为很重要则使用 vLLM。如果测试路由或长上下文模式则使用 SGLang。

8×H100 / H200 node: Start with vLLM or SGLang. Benchmark TensorRT-LLM if NVIDIA-only and performance justifies tuning. Use Dynamo when multi-node orchestration becomes necessary.

B200 / GB200 / GB300-class infrastructure: Benchmark TensorRT-LLM, SGLang, and vLLM. Add Dynamo for fleet-level orchestration, KV-aware routing, and autoscaling.

AMD MI300 / MI325 / MI350 / MI355: Start with vLLM or SGLang on ROCm. Avoid assuming NVIDIA benchmarks transfer cleanly.

Intel Xeon / Core Ultra / Arc: OpenVINO 生成式 AI 或 OpenVINO Model Server。如果应用嵌入很重要，则使用 ONNX Runtime 生成式 AI。

Browser, mobile, app-native: MLC LLM / WebLLM or ONNX Runtime GenAI.

## Benchmarking: what to measure

Bad benchmark: "I got 180 tok/s."

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HIyS6ZyXoAA6C-8?format=jpg&name=large)

Good benchmark includes:

Model: exact model, architecture, parameter count, active MoE params.

Weights: dtype, quant format, group size, calibration.

引擎：版本，提交，后端，标志。

Hardware: GPU SKU, memory capacity, bandwidth, interconnect, CPU, RAM.

Workload: input/output length distributions, concurrency, streaming, shared prefixes, structured output.

Metrics: TTFT, TPOT, end-to-end latency, p50/p95/p99, tokens per second, requests per second, GPU memory usage, KV cache hit rate, prefill throughput, decode throughput, cost per 1M tokens.

Benchmarking Rules:

1.  Never compare engines using only single-user tokens per second.
2.  Test your actual prompt and output distribution.
3.  Test with realistic concurrency.
4.  Separate prefill from decode.
5.  Track p95 and p99, not only averages.
6.  Measure memory headroom at target context length.
7.  Test cache reuse if your app has repeated prefixes.
8.  Benchmark structured output separately; grammar adds overhead.
9.  Benchmark LoRA and multi-LoRA separately.
10.  Re-test after driver, CUDA, ROCm, model, or engine upgrades.

## Common mistakes

Choosing by VRAM capacity alone. VRAM determines fit. Bandwidth and scheduler determine speed. A large unified-memory machine can fit huge models, but an H100 decodes faster when the model fits due to much higher HBM bandwidth.

Using tensor parallelism on weak interconnect. Without NVLink or NVSwitch, test pipeline parallelism. vLLM's docs call this out for L40S-like setups.

忽略 KV 缓存。长上下文和并发可能使 KV 缓存成为限制因素。PagedAttention、前缀缓存、KV 量化和解聚合在规模化时不是可选的。

Treating local engines as production servers. llama.cpp server is capable. MLX-LM server is convenient. Ollama is pleasant yet SHOULD NOT BE USED.

However, production means security, observability, backpressure, routing, autoscaling, and SLA behavior. MLX-LM itself warns that its server is not recommended for production.

假设每种量化格式都是可移植的。GGUF、EXL2、EXL3、AWQ、GPTQ、FP8、FP4、MLX 格式以及 ONNX 格式并不互通。正确的格式是你的引擎已针对其优化核心的那种格式。

忽略模型架构。密集模型、MoE、混合注意力、多模态模型以及长上下文变体影响引擎的不同部分。广泛支持并不意味着每种优化的效果都相同。

Trusting benchmark charts without workload shape. A chart for Llama 3.1 8B at 1K input / 128 output says little about a coding agent with 80K context running on Qwen 3.6 27B / Gemma 4 26B-A4B, or a RAG service with 500 concurrent users.

## The opinionated final map

Local AI user: LM Studio or

[Harbor](https://github.com/av/harbor) for convenience. llama.cpp for control. MLX on Mac. ExLlamaV2/V3 for CUDA local performance.

Building a local agent: Any should work, but given what most people use; llama.cpp for portability. MLX if users are on Apple Silicon. vLLM if simulating production serving locally.

Serving an internal team: Start with vLLM. Use SGLang if structured outputs, long context, multi-LoRA, MoE, or routing matter.

Serving customers at scale: Benchmark vLLM, SGLang, and TensorRT-LLM. If routing and disaggregation matter, SGLang and Dynamo deserve attention.

NVIDIA datacenter: TensorRT-LLM for max performance. vLLM for flexibility. SGLang for complex serving. Dynamo for fleet orchestration.

Apple Silicon: MLX for native development. llama.cpp for GGUF. Unified memory is a capacity superpower with bandwidth tradeoffs, not HBM.

Edge, app, browser, or Windows-native: llama.cpp, MLC LLM, ONNX Runtime GenAI, or OpenVINO, depending on stack.

## Final principle

Inference Engines have consequences.

Pick the engine after answering these:

1.  What hardware do I actually have?
2.  Does the model fit in fast memory, or only in system/unified memory?
3.  Is decode or prefill the bottleneck?
4.  What context length and concurrency matter?
5.  Are prompts shared enough for prefix caching?
6.  Is the model dense, MoE, multimodal, or hybrid?
7.  Do I need local convenience, production serving, or fleet orchestration?
8.  What quantization format has optimized kernels on my target engine?
9.  Is my interconnect PCIe, NVLink, NVSwitch, Ethernet, RDMA, or Thunderbolt?
10.  Am I optimizing latency, throughput, cost, privacy, portability, or developer speed?

The engine follows the answers.

Until next time.

## 怎么做基准测试？

不要只看：

> 单用户 tok/s

应该看：

- TTFT：首 token 延迟
- TPOT：每 token 延迟
- p95 / p99 延迟
- 吞吐量
- 并发数
- 输入 / 输出长度
- KV Cache 命中率
- 显存占用
- 每百万 token 成本

一句话：  
**用你的真实业务测，不要迷信别人图表。**

---

## 常见错误

### 错误 1：只看显存

显存只能说明模型能不能放下。  
速度还要看内存带宽。

---

### 错误 2：把本地工具当生产服务

例如：

- llama.cpp 可以本地服务
- MLX-LM 可以开 server
- Ollama 很方便

但它们不等于真正生产服务。

生产还需要：

- 安全
- 监控
- 限流
- 路由
- 扩缩容
- SLA

---

### 错误 3：多 GPU 乱用张量并行

如果没有 NVLink / NVSwitch，张量并行可能很慢。  
有时流水线并行更合适。

---

### 错误 4：迷信排行榜

不同模型、上下文、并发、量化格式，结果完全不同。

---

## 我的意见

### 个人用户

优先：

1. **llama.cpp**
2. **MLX**
3. **ExLlamaV2 / V3**

如果只是聊天、本地助手、离线使用，没必要复杂化。

---

### Mac 用户

优先：

1. **MLX**
2. **llama.cpp**

Mac 的优势是统一内存，适合“装得下大模型”。  
但别误以为它一定比 NVIDIA 快。

---

### 公司内部服务

优先：

1. **vLLM**
2. **SGLang**

大多数团队从 vLLM 开始最稳。  
如果长上下文、MoE、路由复杂，再看 SGLang。

---

### NVIDIA 数据中心

优先：

1. **TensorRT-LLM**
2. **vLLM**
3. **SGLang**
4. **Dynamo**

如果钱已经花在 H100 / B200 上，就应该认真测试 TensorRT-LLM。

---

## 最终判断原则

选引擎前先问：

1. 我有什么硬件？
2. 模型能不能放进高速显存？
3. 瓶颈是 prefill 还是 decode？
4. 上下文多长？
5. 并发多少？
6. 是否需要生产服务？
7. 是否需要多 GPU / 多节点？
8. 是否追求速度、成本、隐私还是便携？

---

## 最精炼结论

> **本地跑：llama.cpp / MLX / ExLlama。**  
> **生产服务：vLLM 起步，复杂场景 SGLang。**  
> **NVIDIA 极限性能：TensorRT-LLM。**  
> **集群编排：Dynamo。**

**先定硬件和业务，再选推理引擎。**

**一句话点评**: 一篇面向LLM推理部署的高价值选型地图，实践指导性强，但证据主要依赖经验总结而非系统数据。
**核心高价值点**: 不要先选推理引擎，而应先明确硬件策略、工作负载形态、服务模型和瓶颈，再让引擎选择自然浮现。

### 摘要
文章系统梳理了LLM推理引擎的选型逻辑，强调应先确定硬件、工作负载和服务模型，再选择llama.cpp、MLX、ExLlama、vLLM、SGLang、TensorRT-LLM等工具，并给出基准测试指标和常见误区。

### 知识要点
- LLM推理主要分为prefill和decode两个阶段，前者偏计算密集，后者更受内存带宽限制
- 显存容量决定模型能否装下，内存带宽和调度器质量决定实际解码速度和服务表现
- llama.cpp适合可移植、本地、边缘和混合卸载场景，不适合严肃多节点生产服务
- vLLM是开源生产服务的默认起点，SGLang更适合长上下文、MoE、结构化输出和复杂路由场景
- TensorRT-LLM适合深度绑定NVIDIA数据中心并追求极致性能的场景
- 基准测试应关注TTFT、TPOT、p95/p99、并发、上下文长度、KV缓存命中率和成本，而不是单用户tok/s

### 行动项
- 根据自己的硬件、模型类型、上下文长度、并发量和服务目标建立推理引擎选型表
- 对候选引擎使用真实业务输入/输出分布进行基准测试，而不是引用通用排行榜
- 在部署前分别评估prefill、decode、KV缓存、并行方式和互联瓶颈
- 如果是生产服务，优先测试vLLM或SGLang；如果是NVIDIA高端集群，再加入TensorRT-LLM和Dynamo对比

### 存档判定
归档: 是 — 原因: 提供了较完整的推理引擎分类、硬件匹配策略、基准测试指标和常见误区，具备较高复用价值
删除: 否
留存决策: 长期保留，适合作为LLM推理引擎和硬件策略选型的参考清单

### 📋 提示词模板: 结构化

[Prompt: 结构化]

### 🤖 AI

# 《LLM 的推理引擎及本地 AI 硬件（2026 年版）》精炼总结

LLM 推理引擎不是先选的，而是由**硬件策略、工作负载形态、服务模式**决定的。推理引擎本质上是把硬件转化为可用推理能力的软件层，负责调度、缓存、并行、API、量化和部署等工作。

---

## 1. 核心观点：先定硬件和场景，再选推理引擎

作者强调，不应先问“用哪个推理引擎”，而应先明确：

- 你有什么硬件：Mac、消费级 NVIDIA、多卡服务器、CPU、移动端等。
- 工作负载是什么：短提示长输出、长提示短输出、长上下文、MoE、多用户并发等。
- 服务模式是什么：本地聊天、内部服务、生产环境、集群编排。

推理引擎不是模型本身，而是：

- 交通调度员
- 内存管理器
- Kernel 调度器
- 请求调度器
- KV Cache 管理器
- 并行策略规划器
- API 服务层
- 有时也是部署框架

---

## 2. 一页决策指南：不同场景对应不同引擎

按作者建议，可以这样快速选择：

| 场景 | 推荐引擎 |
|---|---|
| 笔记本、边缘设备、奇怪硬件 | `llama.cpp` |
| Mac 优先工作流 | `MLX / MLX-LM` |
| 2-4 张以上 NVIDIA / CUDA GPU | `ExLlamaV3` |
| 通用生产级服务 | `vLLM` |
| 长上下文、MoE、复杂路由 | `SGLang` |
| NVIDIA 极致性能 | `TensorRT-LLM` |
| 集群级编排 | `NVIDIA Dynamo` |

核心原则：**引擎跟随硬件和需求，而不是反过来。**

---

## 3. 推理过程的两个阶段：Prefill 和 Decode

LLM 推理主要分为两个阶段：

### Prefill：处理输入提示词

- 读取 prompt，构建初始 KV Cache。
- 更偏向**计算密集型**。
- 长 prompt、短输出时，Prefill 是主要瓶颈。
- 需要关注 attention kernel、chunked prefill 等优化。

### Decode：逐 token 生成输出

- 每次生成一个 token，不断读取权重和 KV Cache。
- 更偏向**内存带宽瓶颈**。
- 短 prompt、长输出时，Decode 是主要瓶颈。
- 速度更依赖内存带宽，而不是峰值算力。

### 长上下文场景

长上下文时，KV Cache 会成为主要压力点，需要：

- Paged Attention
- KV Cache 量化
- KV Cache Offload
- Prefix Caching

---

## 4. 真正的瓶颈：不只是显存大小

### 4.1 内存带宽比容量更影响速度

- 显存 / 内存容量决定模型能否装下。
- 内存带宽决定 Decode 速度。

文中给出重要数据：

- Apple M3 Ultra 统一内存带宽最高约 **819 GB/s**。
- NVIDIA H100 SXM GPU 内存带宽约 **3.35 TB/s**。

结论：

- Apple 统一内存适合“装下更大的模型”。
- NVIDIA HBM 更适合“模型装得下时跑得更快”。
- **能装下不等于跑得快。容量不等于带宽。**

### 4.2 多 GPU 会引入通信成本

模型跨 GPU 后，会产生通信开销：

- Tensor Parallelism 需要频繁 all-reduce。
- Pipeline Parallelism 在阶段边界通信。
- Expert Parallelism 在 MoE 中需要 all-to-all 通信。

如果没有 NVLink，vLLM 文档也指出：  
**Pipeline Parallelism 可能比 Tensor Parallelism 更合适。**

### 4.3 调度器质量非常关键

优秀的调度器要决定：

- 哪些请求进入 batch。
- Prefill 和 Decode 如何共享 GPU。
- 长 prompt 是否会阻塞短 decode。
- 如何避免请求饥饿。
- 如何控制延迟和吞吐。

“支持 batching”不等于“具备生产级调度能力”。

---

## 5. 推理引擎的四大家族

作者将主流引擎分为四类：

### 5.1 可移植本地运行时

代表：

- `llama.cpp`
- `MLC LLM`
- `ONNX Runtime GenAI`
- `OpenVINO`
- Ollama 类工具

目标是：**让模型尽可能在各种硬件上跑起来。**

### 5.2 Apple / 统一内存运行时

代表：

- `MLX`
- `MLX-LM`

目标是：**充分利用 Apple Silicon 和统一内存。**

### 5.3 消费级 CUDA 量化引擎

代表：

- `ExLlamaV2`
- `ExLlamaV3`

目标是：**让 RTX 3090 / 4090 / 5090 等消费级 NVIDIA 机器跑得很快。**

### 5.4 生产级服务引擎

代表：

- `vLLM`
- `SGLang`
- `TensorRT-LLM`
- `TGI`
- `LMDeploy`

目标是处理：

- 并发用户
- KV Cache
- batching
- 并行
- 可观测性
- 每 token 成本

此外，还有 `NVIDIA Dynamo` 这类编排层，位于多个引擎之上，负责集群路由、解聚合、自动扩缩容等。

---

## 6. llama.cpp：可移植性之王

`llama.cpp` 适合硬件复杂、离线、本地、CPU-heavy、边缘设备等场景。

它支持：

- Apple Silicon：ARM NEON、Accelerate、Metal
- x86：AVX / AVX2 / AVX512 / AMX
- RISC-V
- CUDA
- AMD HIP
- Vulkan
- SYCL
- CPU + GPU 混合 offload
- GGUF 和低比特量化

`llama-server` 也不是玩具，支持：

- OpenAI 兼容 API
- Anthropic Messages API
- reranking
- continuous batching
- 多模态
- JSON schema 约束
- function calling
- speculative decoding
- Web UI

但关键限制是：

- 不适合严肃的多节点生产服务。
- RPC backend 被文档标注为概念验证、脆弱且不安全。

结论：

> 当你重视可移植性、离线运行、GGUF、混合 offload 时，用 llama.cpp。  
> 不建议用于严肃多 GPU / 多节点生产服务。

---

## 7. MLX / MLX-LM：Apple Silicon 的优势工具

`MLX` 是 Apple 为 Apple Silicon 设计的数组框架，`MLX-LM` 是其 LLM 工具包。

最大特点是：**统一内存**。

在 Apple Silicon 上：

- CPU 和 GPU 共享同一块内存。
- 不需要像独立显卡那样在系统内存和显存之间搬数据。
- 问题从“是否装得进 VRAM”变成“是否装得进统一内存，以及内存带宽是否够”。

这让 Mac 可以运行一些无法塞进 24GB 消费级 GPU 的大型量化模型。

但代价是：

- 速度通常不如高带宽 HBM GPU。

`MLX-LM` 支持：

- Hugging Face Hub
- 量化
- LoRA 和全量微调
- 分布式推理
- MLX Community 模型生态

它也扩展到 Linux CUDA 和 CPU-only 包，分布式通信支持：

- MPI
- TCP Ring
- JACCL
- NCCL

但 MLX-LM server 自身提示：  
**不推荐用于生产环境，因为只有基础安全检查。**

结论：

> Mac 原生开发和本地 LLM 工作流优先用 MLX；高并发公开服务应使用真正的生产服务栈。

---

## 8. ExLlamaV2 / V3：消费级 CUDA 的高性能选择

适用场景：

- 单 RTX 3090 / 4090 / 5090
- 本地代码助手
- 本地聊天
- EXL2 量化模型
- 高端个人工作站

`ExLlamaV2` 是发烧友常用的本地 CUDA 推理引擎。

`ExLlamaV3` 更适合：

- 2-4 张以上消费级 NVIDIA GPU
- 本地 MoE 模型
- 多 GPU 量化推理

但要注意：

- 部分模型不支持 ExLlamaV3 的 tensor parallelism 或 expert parallelism。
- 能力更强，但边缘情况和限制也更多。

结论：

> 单卡本地 CUDA 用 ExLlamaV2；2-4 卡本地多 GPU 可以考虑 ExLlamaV3。

---

## 9. vLLM：开源生产服务的默认起点

作者认为，严肃的开源 LLM 生产服务，很多团队应首先评估 `vLLM`。

它具备：

- PagedAttention KV 内存管理
- Continuous batching
- Chunked prefill
- Prefix caching
- CUDA / HIP graphs
- FP8、MXFP8、MXFP4、NVFP4、INT8、INT4、GPTQ、AWQ、GGUF 等量化支持
- 优化 attention、GEMM、MoE kernels
- Speculative decoding
- torch.compile
- Prefill / Decode / Encode 解聚合

它支持多种并行：

- Tensor Parallelism
- Pipeline Parallelism
- Data Parallelism
- Expert Parallelism
- Context Parallelism

API 和功能方面也很完整：

- Streaming
- Structured outputs
- Tool calling
- OpenAI-compatible API
- Anthropic Messages API
- gRPC
- Multi-LoRA

硬件支持包括：

- NVIDIA
- AMD
- x86 / ARM / PowerPC CPU
- TPU、Gaudi、Ascend、Apple Silicon 等插件支持

但作者提醒：  
vLLM 不会自动替你完成系统设计。仍需调优：

- batching
- context length
- GPU memory utilization
- 并行布局
- 请求路由

结论：

> 如果要生产化服务开源模型，vLLM 是默认起点。

---

## 10. SGLang：面向复杂服务场景的系统型引擎

`SGLang` 适合更复杂、更“脏”的服务负载，例如：

- 结构化输出
- 长上下文
- MoE
- Prefill / Decode 解聚合
- 请求路由
- Multi-LoRA

它支持：

- RadixAttention prefix caching
- Prefill-Decode Disaggregation
- Speculative decoding
- Continuous batching
- Paged attention
- Tensor / Pipeline / Expert / Data Parallelism
- Structured outputs
- Chunked prefill
- Multi-LoRA batching

支持硬件包括：

- NVIDIA
- AMD
- Intel Xeon
- Google TPU
- Ascend NPU 等

其关键差异是服务架构：

- 将计算密集的 Prefill 和内存密集的 Decode 分到不同实例。
- 在实例间传输 KV Cache。
- 避免长 Prefill 阻塞 Decode，降低 token latency 抖动。

结论：

> 当瓶颈不再是“能不能跑模型”，而是“能不能在复杂流量下控制延迟、内存和成本”时，SGLang 更值得考虑。

---

## 11. TensorRT-LLM：NVIDIA 极致性能路线

`TensorRT-LLM` 是 NVIDIA 专用高性能栈，重点不是可移植，而是最大性能。

它提供：

- 构建 TensorRT engine 的 Python API
- Python 和 C++ runtime
- 自定义 attention、GEMM、MoE kernels
- Prefill-Decode 解聚合
- Wide Expert Parallelism
- Speculative decoding
- 与 NVIDIA Dynamo 和 Triton Inference Server 集成

重要数据：

- B200 GPU 可使用优化 kernel 加载 FP4 权重。
- H100 及更新 GPU 支持 FP8 量化。
- FP8 相比 16-bit 可在精度损失较小的情况下：
  - 性能最高约翻倍
  - 内存占用约减半

适合：

- H100 / H200 / B200 / GB200 / GB300 级 NVIDIA 集群
- NVIDIA-only 数据中心
- FP8 / FP4 部署
- 多节点服务
- 大规模 MoE

不适合：

- AMD / Apple / Intel 可移植需求
- 快速变化的实验模型
- 小型本地部署
- 希望“一套到处跑”的团队

结论：

> 如果你完全投入 NVIDIA 生态并追求极限性能，TensorRT-LLM 必须参与评测；代价是牺牲可移植性。

---

## 14. Benchmark 应该怎么做

作者批评只看一句“我跑到了 180 tok/s”的 benchmark，因为这没有意义。

好的 benchmark 应包含：

### 模型信息

- 精确模型名
- 架构
- 参数量
- MoE 活跃参数量

### 权重信息

- dtype
- 量化格式
- group size
- calibration 方式

### 硬件信息

- GPU 型号
- 显存容量
- 内存带宽
- 互联方式
- CPU
- RAM

### 工作负载

- 输入 / 输出长度分布
- 并发数
- 是否 streaming
- 是否共享 prefix
- 是否结构化输出

### 指标

- TTFT：首 token 时间
- TPOT：每 token 时间
- 端到端延迟
- p50 / p95 / p99
- tokens/s
- requests/s
- GPU 显存使用
- KV Cache 命中率
- Prefill 吞吐
- Decode 吞吐
- 每 100 万 token 成本

### Benchmark 规则

- 不要只用单用户 tok/s 比较引擎。
- 使用真实 prompt 和输出分布。
- 测真实并发。
- 分开测 Prefill 和 Decode。
- 关注 p95 / p99，而不只是平均值。
- 测目标上下文长度下的内存余量。
- 有重复 prompt 时测试 cache reuse。
- 单独测试结构化输出，因为 grammar 会增加开销。
- 单独测试 LoRA / Multi-LoRA。
- 驱动、CUDA、ROCm、模型或引擎升级后要重新测试。

---

## 15. 常见错误

### 错误 1：只看显存容量

- VRAM 决定能不能放下。
- 带宽和调度器决定速度。
- 大统一内存机器可以装下大模型，但 H100 在模型能装下时 Decode 更快。

### 错误 2：弱互联上强行 Tensor Parallelism

没有 NVLink / NVSwitch 时，要测试 Pipeline Parallelism。  
例如 L40S 类配置下，vLLM 文档就提醒过这一点。

### 错误 3：把本地引擎当生产服务器

- `llama.cpp server` 很强，但不是完整生产栈。
- `MLX-LM server` 很方便，但自己提示不推荐生产。
- Ollama 体验友好，但作者不建议使用。

真正的生产服务需要：

- 安全
- 可观测性
- 背压
- 路由
- 自动扩缩容
- SLA 行为

### 错误 4：盲信 benchmark 图表

例如，一个关于 Llama 3.1 8B、1K 输入、128 输出的 benchmark，不能代表：

- 80K 上下文 coding agent
- Qwen 3.6 27B
- Gemma 4 26B-A4B
- 500 并发 RAG 服务

必须按自己的真实工作负载测试。

---

## 17. 最终原则：引擎由答案决定

选择推理引擎前，应先回答这些问题：

- 我实际有什么硬件？
- 模型是装进高速显存，还是只能放进系统 / 统一内存？
- 瓶颈是 Prefill 还是 Decode？
- 需要多长上下文、多高并发？
- prompt 是否有共享前缀，能否利用 prefix caching？
- 模型是 dense、MoE、多模态还是混合架构？
- 我需要本地方便、生产服务，还是集群编排？
- 目标引擎是否有对应量化格式的优化 kernel？
- 互联是 PCIe、NVLink、NVSwitch、Ethernet、RDMA 还是 Thunderbolt？
- 优化目标是延迟、吞吐、成本、隐私、可移植性，还是开发速度？

最终结论：

> **推理引擎不是起点，而是硬件、工作负载和服务目标的结果。**

[Prompt: 综合-启发一下]

### 🤖 AI

# LLM 推理引擎与本地 AI 硬件：精炼解读

> 核心判断：**不要先选推理引擎。先确定硬件策略、负载形态、服务模式，再反推引擎。**  
> 推理引擎不是“模型”，而是调度器、内存管理器、KV Cache 管家、并行策略执行者、API 层和部署框架的组合。

---

## 1. 启发

### 1.1 推理引擎选择，本质是系统设计问题

很多人会问：

> “我该用 vLLM、llama.cpp、SGLang 还是 TensorRT-LLM？”

但更正确的问题是：

> “我的硬件是什么？我的请求形态是什么？我服务多少并发？我追求吞吐、延迟、成本、隐私还是可移植性？”

推理引擎不是孤立工具，而是硬件、模型、流量、成本之间的协调层。

---

### 1.2 “能跑”不等于“跑得好”

文章反复强调一个关键区分：

- **VRAM / 内存容量决定模型能不能放下**
- **内存带宽决定 Decode 阶段跑得快不快**
- **调度器决定并发下体验稳不稳**
- **互联决定多 GPU 是否真的有收益**

例如：

- Apple M 系列大统一内存可以装下更大模型，但带宽不如 H100 HBM。
- H100 显存未必最大，但 HBM 带宽极高，Decode 更强。
- 多张消费级 GPU 如果没有 NVLink，Tensor Parallelism 可能反而拖后腿。

一句话：

> Fit is not speed. Capacity is not bandwidth.

---

### 1.3 LLM 推理要拆成两个阶段理解

LLM 推理不是一个均质过程，而是两类瓶颈：

| 阶段 | 做什么 | 主要瓶颈 | 典型优化 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prefill | 处理 prompt，构建 KV Cache | 计算密集 | Attention kernel、chunked prefill |
| Decode | 一个 token 一个 token 生成 | 内存带宽密集 | KV Cache 管理、batching、带宽优化 |

对应到产品场景：

| 场景 | 主瓶颈 |
|---|---|
| 短输入、长输出 | Decode 主导 |
| 长输入、短输出 | Prefill 主导 |
| 超长上下文 | KV Cache 主导 |
| 多用户并发 | Scheduler 主导 |
| 多 GPU / 多节点 | Interconnect 主导 |

---

## 2. 高价值信息深挖

### 2.1 推理引擎的真正角色

一个成熟的 inference engine 通常要做：

- 权重加载
- tokenizer
- forward pass
- token sampling
- KV Cache 维护
- 流式输出
- continuous batching
- prefix caching
- chunked prefill
- quantization 支持
- 多 GPU 并行
- OpenAI-compatible API
- 观测指标
- 调度与限流
- 分布式执行

所以，推理引擎不是“把模型跑起来”的小工具，而是 **LLM 服务操作系统**。

## 5. 可迁移清单

### 5.1 选型前必须回答的 10 个问题

1. 我实际有什么硬件？
2. 模型是否能放进高速显存，而不是普通内存？
3. 瓶颈是 Prefill 还是 Decode？
4. 目标上下文长度是多少？
5. 目标并发是多少？
6. 请求是否有大量共享前缀，能否利用 prefix caching？
7. 模型是 dense、MoE、multimodal 还是 hybrid？
8. 我需要本地便利、生产服务，还是 fleet 编排？
9. 目标量化格式是否有优化 kernel？
10. 我的互联是 PCIe、NVLink、NVSwitch、Ethernet、RDMA 还是 Thunderbolt？

---

### 5.2 Benchmark 必测指标

不要只测：

> “单用户 180 tok/s”

要测：

#### 模型信息

- 模型名
- 参数量
- 架构
- dense / MoE
- active params
- context length

#### 权重信息

- dtype
- quant 格式
- group size
- calibration 方法

#### 硬件信息

- GPU 型号
- 显存容量
- 内存带宽
- GPU 间互联
- CPU
- RAM

#### 工作负载信息

- input length 分布
- output length 分布
- 并发数
- streaming 与否
- 是否共享 prefix
- 是否 structured output
- 是否 multi-LoRA

#### 指标

- TTFT：首 token 延迟
- TPOT：每 token 延迟
- end-to-end latency
- p50 / p95 / p99
- tokens/s
- requests/s
- GPU memory usage
- KV Cache hit rate
- prefill throughput
- decode throughput
- cost per 1M tokens

---

### 5.3 Benchmark 规则

1. 不要只用单用户 tok/s 比较引擎。
2. 使用真实 prompt 和 output 分布。
3. 必须测试真实并发。
4. 分开测 prefill 和 decode。
5. 看 p95 / p99，而不是只看平均值。
6. 测目标 context length 下的内存余量。
7. 如果有重复 prompt，要测 prefix cache hit。
8. structured output 单独测。
9. LoRA / multi-LoRA 单独测。
10. 驱动、CUDA、ROCm、模型、engine 升级后重新测。

---

## 6. 常见错误

### 6.1 只看显存容量

错误：

> “这台机器内存更大，所以一定更快。”

正确：

> 显存 / 内存决定能不能放下，带宽和调度决定跑得快不快。

---

### 6.2 在弱互联上盲目使用 Tensor Parallelism

如果没有 NVLink / NVSwitch，多 GPU 通信可能成为瓶颈。

在 PCIe 多卡机器上，应该测试：

- tensor parallelism
- pipeline parallelism
- data parallelism
- expert parallelism

不要默认 TP 最优。

---

### 6.3 把本地工具当生产服务

llama.cpp server、MLX-LM server 很方便，但生产不只是 API 能通。

生产服务还需要：

- 安全
- 认证
- 限流
- 回压
- observability
- autoscaling
- routing
- SLA
- 灰度
- 故障恢复
- 成本监控

---

### 6.4 信任脱离负载形态的 benchmark

一个 benchmark 如果只说明：

> Llama 8B，1K input，128 output，单用户 tok/s

它几乎无法指导：

- 80K context coding agent
- 500 并发 RAG
- MoE 服务
- structured output agent
- 多租户企业 API
- 多 LoRA personalized assistant

---

## 7. 反方与张力

### 7.1 统一内存 vs HBM

Apple Silicon 的统一内存优势：

- 容量大
- 编程模型简单
- 本地可装大模型
- 适合个人和开发者

但劣势：

- 带宽低于高端 HBM
- 并发服务能力弱
- 不适合高吞吐生产

张力：

> 大内存让你“能跑”，HBM 让你“跑得快”。

---

### 7.2 通用灵活 vs 极致性能

vLLM / SGLang：

- 灵活
- 生态好
- 模型支持广
- 开源生产友好

TensorRT-LLM：

- 性能极强
- NVIDIA 优化深
- 但绑定 NVIDIA
- 调优成本高

张力：

> 通用性与极致性能不可兼得。  
> 越专用，越快；越通用，越灵活。

---

### 7.3 本地自主 vs 生产稳定

本地工具带来：

- 隐私
- 离线
- 控制感
- 低门槛

但生产系统需要：

- 调度
- 监控
- 扩缩容
- 多租户隔离
- 安全
- 成本可控

张力：

> Local-first 是产品体验优势，不等于 serving-ready。

---

### 7.4 单机优化 vs 集群编排

单机阶段：

- 关注显存、带宽、量化、batching

集群阶段：

- 关注路由、prefill/decode 解耦、KV Cache 迁移、autoscaling、故障恢复

张力：

> 当规模变大，问题从“推理性能”转为“分布式系统效率”。

---

### 7.5 平均吞吐 vs 尾延迟

很多 benchmark 追求平均 tok/s。

但真实产品更关心：

- p95
- p99
- TTFT
- 用户等待感
- 高峰时稳定性

张力：

> 系统可以平均很快，但用户感知很慢。

---

## 10. 最终浓缩版

### 如果你只记住 7 句话

1. **先选硬件策略和 workload，再选推理引擎。**
2. **VRAM 决定能不能放下，带宽决定 decode 快不快。**
3. **Prefill 是计算密集，Decode 是内存带宽密集。**
4. **高并发下，scheduler 比单用户 tok/s 更重要。**
5. **多 GPU 是否有效，取决于互联，不取决于卡数。**
6. **vLLM 是通用生产起点，SGLang 适合复杂 serving，TensorRT-LLM 适合 NVIDIA 极致性能。**
7. **本地便利工具不等于生产服务框架。**

---

## 11. 一句话结论

> LLM 推理引擎的选择，不是工具偏好问题，而是硬件、负载、并发、缓存、互联和成本共同决定的系统设计问题。  
> **答案不是“哪个 engine 最好”，而是“在我的约束下，哪个 engine 的系统假设最匹配”。**
