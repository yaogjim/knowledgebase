Skills have become one of the most used extension points in Claude Code. They’re flexible, easy to make, and easy to distribute.

But this flexibility also makes it hard to know what works best. What type of skills are worth making? How do you structure a skill? When do you share them with others?

We've been using skills in Claude Code extensively at Anthropic with hundreds of them in active use. These are the lessons we've learned about using skills to accelerate our development.

## What are skills?

Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and use to do things more accurately and efficiently. This blog post assumes familiarity with skills basics; if you’re new, start with our [Introduction to agent skills course on Skilljar](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/introduction-to-agent-skills).

A common misconception we hear about skills is that they are “just markdown files.” They’re actually folders that can include scripts, assets, data, etc. that the agent can discover, explore and manipulate.

In Claude Code, skills also have a [wide variety of configuration options](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills#frontmatter-reference) including registering dynamic hooks.

We’ve found that some of the most effective skills in Claude Code use these configuration options and folder structure effectively.

## Types of skills

After cataloging all of our internal skills at Anthropic, we noticed they cluster into nine categories. The best skills fit cleanly into one; the ones that try to do too much straddle several and confuse the agent. This isn't a definitive list, but it is a useful framework for identifying gaps in your own skills library.

![The Claude Code team categorized our internal skills and found that they could be bucketed into nine distinct categories.](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68a44d4040f98a4adf2207b6/6a1f3a763cec27e2f026439c_b7942952.png)

The Claude Code team categorized our internal skills and found that they could be bucketed into nine distinct categories.

### 1\. Library and API reference

These are skills that explain how to correctly use a library, CLI, or SDKs. They could be both for internal libraries or common libraries that Claude Code sometimes struggles to handle. These skills often included a folder of reference code snippets and a list of gotchas for Claude to avoid when writing a script.

Examples include:

- `billing-lib` — your internal billing library: edge cases, footguns, etc.
- `internal-platform-cli` — every subcommand of your internal CLI wrapper with examples on when to use them.
- `sandbox-proxy` — configuring your org's egress gateway for dev work: which hosts are reachable, how to debug "connection refused" errors, how to add an allowlist entry.

### 2\. Product verification

These are skills that describe how to test or verify that your code is working. They are often paired with playwright, tmux, or other external tools for verification.

Verification skills have had the most measurable impact on Claude’s output quality internally. It can be worth having an engineer spend a week just making your verification skills excellent.

Consider techniques like having Claude record a video of its output so you can see exactly what it tested, or enforcing programmatic assertions on state at each step. These are often done by including a variety of scripts in the skill.

Examples include:

- `signup-flow-driver` — runs through signup → email verify → onboarding in a headless browser, with hooks for asserting state at each step
- `checkout-verifier` — drives the checkout UI with Stripe test cards, verifies the invoice actually lands in the right state
- `tmux-cli-driver` — for interactive CLI testing where the thing you're verifying needs a TTY

### 3\. Data fetching and analysis

These are skills that connect to your data and monitoring stacks. These skills might include libraries to fetch your data with credentials, specific dashboard ids, etc., as well as instructions on common workflows or ways to get data.

Examples include:

- `funnel-query` — "which events do I join to see signup → activation → paid" plus the table that actually has the canonical user\_id
- `cohort-compare` — compare two cohorts' retention or conversion, flag statistically significant deltas, link to the segment definitions
- `grafana` — datasource UIDs, cluster names, problem → dashboard lookup table
- `datadog` — field reference (@request\_id vs trace\_id), service list, metric prefix conventions

### 4\. Business process and team automation

These are skills that automate repetitive workflows into one command. These skills are usually fairly simple instructions but might have more complicated dependencies on other skills or MCPs. For these skills, saving previous results in log files can help the model stay consistent and reflect on previous executions of the workflow.

Examples include:

- `standup-post` — aggregates your ticket tracker, GitHub activity, and prior Slack → formatted standup, delta-only
- `create-<ticket-system>-ticket` — enforces schema (valid enum values, required fields) plus post-creation workflow (ping reviewer, link in Slack)
- `weekly-recap` — merged PRs + closed tickets + deploys → formatted recap post

### 5\. Code scaffolding and templates

These are skills that generate framework boilerplates for a specific function in a codebase. You might combine these skills with scripts that can be composed. They are especially useful when your scaffolding has natural language requirements that can’t be purely covered by code.

Examples include:

- `new-<framework>-workflow` — scaffolds a new service/workflow/handler with your annotations
- `new-migration` — your migration file template plus common gotchas
- `create-app` — new internal app with your auth, logging, and deploy config pre-wired

### 6\. Code quality and review

These are skills that enforce code quality inside of your org and help review code. These can include deterministic scripts or tools for maximum robustness. You may want to run these skills automatically as part of hooks or inside of a GitHub Action.

- `adversarial-review` — spawns a fresh-eyes subagent to critique, implements fixes, iterates until findings degrade to nitpicks
- `code-style` — enforces code style, especially styles that Claude does not do well by default.
- `testing-practices` — instructions on how to write tests and what to test.

### 7\. CI/CD and deployment

These are skills that help you fetch, push, and deploy code inside of your codebase. These skills may reference other skills to collect data.

Examples include:

- `babysit-pr` — monitors a PR → retries flaky CI → resolves merge conflicts → enables auto-merge
- `deploy-<service>` — build → smoke test → gradual traffic rollout with error-rate comparison → auto-rollback on regression
- `cherry-pick-prod` — isolated worktree → cherry-pick → conflict resolution → PR with template

### 8\. Runbooks

These are skills that take a symptom (such as a Slack thread, alert, or error signature), walk through a multi-tool investigation, and produce a structured report.

Examples include:

- `<service>-debugging` — maps symptoms → tools → query patterns for your highest-traffic services
- `oncall-runner` — fetches the alert → checks the usual suspects → formats a finding
- `log-correlator` — given a request ID, pulls matching logs from every system that might have touched it

### 9\. Infrastructure operations

These are skills that perform routine maintenance and operational procedures, some of which involve destructive actions that benefit from guardrails. These make it easier for engineers to follow best practices in critical operations.

Examples include:

- `<resource>-orphans` — finds orphaned pods/volumes → posts to Slack → soak period → user confirms → cascading cleanup
- `dependency-management` — your org's dependency approval workflow
- `cost-investigation` — "why did our storage/egress bill spike" with the specific buckets and query patterns

## Tips for making skills

Once you've decided on the skill to make, how do you write it? These are some of the Claude Code team’s best practices, tips, and tricks for making skills

### Don’t state the obvious

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68a44d4040f98a4adf2207b6/6a1f3a763cec27e2f02643a2_6f109d87.png)

The SKILL.md file points to several other files Claude can reference for specific situations. For example, if a job is pending, it should reference stuck-jobs.md.

Claude already knows how to code and can read your codebase. A skill that restates what Claude would do by default adds context without adding value. If you’re publishing a skill that is primarily about knowledge, focus on information that pushes Claude out of its normal way of thinking.

The [frontend design skill](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/skills/frontend-design/SKILL.md) is a great example; it was built by an engineer at Anthropic by iterating with customers on improving Claude’s design taste, avoiding classic patterns like the Inter font and purple gradients.

### Build a gotchas section

The highest-signal content in any skill is the Gotchas section. These sections should be built up from common failure points that Claude runs into when using your skill. Ideally, you will update your skill over time to capture these gotchas.

For example:

"The `subscriptions` table is append-only. The row you want is the one with the highest version, not the most recent `created_at`." "This field is called `@request_id` in the API gateway and `trace_id` in the billing service. They're the same value." "Staging returns 200 even when the Stripe webhook didn't actually process. Check `payment_events` for the real state."

### Use the file system and progressive disclosure

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68a44d4040f98a4adf2207b6/6a1f3a763cec27e2f026439f_0e0f23c0.png)

The SKILL.md file points to several other files Claude can reference for specific situations. For example, if a job is pending, it should reference stuck-jobs.md.

Like we said earlier, a skill is a folder, not just a markdown file. You should think of the entire file system as a form of context engineering and progressive disclosure. Tell Claude what files are in your skill, and it will read them at appropriate times.

The simplest form of progressive disclosure is to point to other markdown files for Claude to use. For example, you may split detailed function signatures and usage examples into `references/api.md`.

Another example: if your end output is a markdown file, you might include a template file for it in `assets/` to copy and use.

You can have folders of references, scripts, examples, etc., which help Claude work more effectively.

### Avoid railroading Claude

Claude will generally try to stick to your instructions, and because skills are so reusable you’ll want to be careful of being too specific in your instructions. Give Claude the information it needs, but give it the flexibility to adapt to the situation.

For example:

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68a44d4040f98a4adf2207b6/6a1f3a763cec27e2f02643ae_3c108f2c.png)

The skill above is written to prompt the user if the Slack channel is not included in the configuration.

### Think through the setup

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68a44d4040f98a4adf2207b6/6a1f3a763cec27e2f02643a8_d5e89124.png)

The skill above is written to prompt the user if the Slack channel is not included in the configuration.

Some skills may need to be set up with context from the user. For example, if you are making a skill that posts your standup to Slack, you may want Claude to ask which Slack channel to post it in.

A good pattern to do this is to store this setup information in a config.json file in the skill directory like the above example. If the config is not set up, the agent can then ask the user for information.

If you want the agent to present structured, multiple choice questions you can instruct Claude to use the AskUserQuestion tool.

### Write descriptions for the model, not for humans

When Claude Code starts a session, it builds a listing of every available skill with its description. This listing is what Claude scans to decide "is there a skill for this request?" Which means the description field is not a summary, it's a description of when to trigger this skill.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68a44d4040f98a4adf2207b6/6a1f3a763cec27e2f0264399_a60f7943.png)

It’s helpful to include triggers for the skill, like “babysit,” in its description.

### Help Claude remember

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68a44d4040f98a4adf2207b6/6a1f3a763cec27e2f02643b1_9159a9b1.png)

This text log file helps Claude remember past events like reviewing Sarah’s auth PR.

Some skills can include a form of memory by storing data within them. You could store data in anything as simple as an append only text log file or JSON files, or as complicated as a SQLite database.

For example, a `standup-post` skill might keep a standups.log with every post it's written, which means the next time you run it, Claude reads its own history and can tell what's changed since yesterday.

You can use the env variable `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` to get a stable directory where you can store data, read more persisting data in skills here: [https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference#persistent-data-directory](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference#persistent-data-directory).

### Store scripts and generate code

One of the most powerful tools you can give Claude is code. Giving Claude scripts and libraries lets Claude spend its turns on composition, deciding what to do next rather than reconstructing boilerplate.

For example, in your `data-science` skill you might have a library of functions to fetch data from your event source. In order for Claude to do complex analysis, you could give it a set of helper functions like this:

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68a44d4040f98a4adf2207b6/6a1f3a763cec27e2f02643ab_00319576.png)

Claude can then generate scripts on the fly to compose this functionality to do more advanced analysis for prompts like “What happened on Tuesday?”

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68a44d4040f98a4adf2207b6/6a1f3a763cec27e2f02643a5_32329bf3.png)

### Use on-demand hooks

Skills can include hooks that are only activated when the skill is called, and that only last for the duration of the session. Use this for more opinionated hooks that you don’t want to run all the time, but are extremely useful sometimes.

For example:

- `/` **`careful`** — blocks rm -rf, DROP TABLE, force-push, kubectl delete via PreToolUse matcher on Bash. You only want this when you know you're touching prod — having it always on would drive you insane.
- `/` **`freeze`** — blocks any Edit/Write that's not in a specific directory. Useful during debugging: "I want to add logs but I keep accidentally 'fixing' unrelated code.”

## Distributing skills

One of the biggest benefits of skills is that you can share them with the rest of your team.

There are two ways you might want to share skills with others:

- check your skills into your repo (under `./.claude/skills`)
- make a **plugin** and have a Claude Code Plugin marketplace where users can upload and install plugins (read more on the [documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces) here)

For smaller teams working across relatively few repos, checking your skills into repos works well. But every skill that is checked in also adds a little bit to the context of the model. As you scale, an internal plugin marketplace allows you to distribute skills and let your team decide which ones to install, as well as include a setup flow.

## Managing a skills marketplace

How do you decide which skills go in a marketplace? How do people submit them?

At Anthropic, we don't have a centralized team that decides; instead we try to find the most useful skills organically. If someone has a skill that they want people to try out, they can upload it to a sandbox folder in GitHub and point people to it in Slack or other forums.

Once a skill has gotten traction (which is up to the skill owner to decide), they can put in a PR to move it into the marketplace.

## Composing skills

You may want to have skills that depend on each other. For example, you may have a file upload skill that uploads a file, and a CSV generation skill that makes a CSV and uploads it. This sort of dependency management is not natively built into marketplaces or skills yet, but you can just reference other skills by name, and the model will invoke them if they are installed.

## Measuring skills

To understand how a skill is doing, we use a PreToolUse hook that lets us log skill usage within the company ([example code here](https://gist.github.com/ThariqS/24defad423d701746e23dc19aace4de5)). This means we can find skills that are popular or are undertriggering compared to our expectations.

## Get started

Skills best practices are still evolving. Most of our best skills began as a few lines and a single gotcha, then got better because people kept adding to them as Claude hit new edge cases.

The best way to understand skills is to get started, experiment, and see what works for you.

# 《Lessons from building Claude Code: How we use skills》精炼解读

## 一、深度总结

这篇文章总结了 Anthropic 在 Claude Code 内部大规模使用「Skills」的经验。

**核心观点：**

> Skill 不是一段提示词，也不只是 Markdown，而是一个可复用的“能力包”：包含说明、脚本、资源、配置、钩子、数据和工作流。

它的价值在于：  
让 AI 不只是“凭经验生成”，而是能调用组织沉淀下来的工具、规则、流程和上下文，从而更稳定、更准确地完成任务。

---

## 二、Skills 的 9 类典型用途

| 类型 | 作用 |
|---|---|
| 1. 库/API 参考 | 教 Claude 正确使用内部库、SDK、CLI |
| 2. 产品验证 | 自动测试 UI、流程、状态，提升输出质量 |
| 3. 数据获取与分析 | 连接监控、数据仓库、日志系统 |
| 4. 业务流程自动化 | 自动写站会、创建工单、生成周报 |
| 5. 代码脚手架 | 生成符合团队规范的模板代码 |
| 6. 代码质量与评审 | 自动审查、测试、风格检查 |
| 7. CI/CD 与部署 | 管 PR、重跑 CI、发布、回滚 |
| 8. Runbook | 按告警或错误线索排查问题 |
| 9. 基础设施运维 | 清理资源、查成本、管理依赖等 |

**最有价值的一类：产品验证 Skills。**  
因为它能让 Claude 不只是“写完代码”，而是能证明代码真的能跑、流程真的正确。

---

## 三、如何写好一个 Skill

### 1. 不要写废话

不要告诉 Claude 它本来就知道的东西。  
真正有价值的是：

- 内部约定
- 特殊流程
- 历史坑点
- 容易误判的边界情况

---

### 2. 一定要有 Gotchas

Gotchas 是最重要的部分。

例如：

> “subscriptions 表是 append-only，要取 version 最高的记录，而不是 created_at 最新的。”

这种信息往往比长篇文档更有用，因为它直接避免 AI 犯错。

---

### 3. 用文件夹做“渐进式上下文”

Skill 应该是一个目录，而不是单文件。

可以包括：

```text
SKILL.md
references/api.md
examples/
scripts/
assets/
config.json
logs/
```

让 Claude 先读总说明，遇到具体场景再读细节。  
这叫 **渐进式披露**，可以减少上下文浪费。

---

### 4. 不要把 Claude 管死

Skill 应该提供信息和边界，而不是写死每一步。

太僵硬的指令会让 Claude 缺乏应变能力。  
好的 Skill 应该像“资深同事的指导”，而不是“死板流程图”。

---

### 5. 描述字段写给模型看

Skill 的 description 不是给人看的简介，而是给 Claude 判断“什么时候该调用这个 Skill”的触发条件。

例如应包含关键词：

```text
用于 babysit PR、监控 CI、解决冲突、启用 auto-merge
```

---

### 6. 让 Skill 有记忆

Skill 可以保存历史记录，例如：

- 上次站会内容
- 之前生成过的报告
- 某个 PR 的审查历史
- 工单处理日志

这样 Claude 下次执行时可以知道“发生了什么变化”。

---

### 7. 给 Claude 脚本，而不只是文字

最强的 Skill 往往不是长提示词，而是包含可执行脚本。

因为脚本能让 Claude 少猜、多验证、多组合。

例如：

- 拉数据脚本
- 浏览器测试脚本
- 日志查询脚本
- 部署检查脚本

---

### 8. 用按需 Hooks 做保护

某些场景需要临时安全机制。

例如：

```text
/careful：禁止 rm -rf、DROP TABLE、force push
/freeze：只允许修改指定目录
```

这类 Hook 不适合一直开启，但在高风险操作中非常有用。

---

## 四、如何分发和管理 Skills

两种方式：

1. 放进代码仓库：适合小团队、少量项目  
2. 做内部插件市场：适合大团队、多人共享、按需安装

Anthropic 的做法不是中心化审批，而是：

> 先让大家自由试用，有人用、有价值，再进入正式市场。

这是一种“自然选择式”的知识沉淀机制。

---

## 五、深入浅出解读

可以把 Skill 理解成：

> 给 AI 配的“工具箱 + 操作手册 + 组织经验 + 安全护栏”。

普通提示词像是：

> “请帮我修车。”

Skill 更像是：

> “这是这辆车的维修手册、常见故障、专用扳手、检测仪、维修记录和安全规范。”

所以 Skill 的本质不是“让 AI 更听话”，而是：

> 让 AI 接入真实组织的工作方式。

它解决的是大模型落地中的核心问题：

- 不知道公司内部系统
- 不懂团队约定
- 容易重复犯历史错误
- 写完代码不会验证
- 不熟悉业务流程
- 高风险操作缺乏保护

好的 Skill，本质上是把团队经验产品化、工具化、可复用化。

---

## 六、文章真正想表达的底层逻辑

这篇文章表面讲 Skills，实际讲的是：

> AI 编程的关键，不只是模型能力，而是上下文工程、工具工程和组织知识工程。

模型再强，也需要：

- 正确的上下文
- 可调用的工具
- 明确的验证方式
- 可沉淀的经验
- 可共享的机制
- 可控的安全边界

未来 AI Agent 的竞争，不只是谁模型更强，而是谁能把组织知识更好地封装成可调用能力。

---

## 七、我的辩证思考

### 1. Skill 是放大器，不是万能药

好的 Skill 能显著提升 AI 质量。  
但烂 Skill 也会放大混乱：

- 写得太宽泛，会误触发
- 写得太死板，会限制模型
- 信息过时，会误导模型
- 缺少维护，会变成技术债

所以 Skill 不是“写一次永久有效”，而是需要持续迭代。

---

### 2. 最重要的不是“多”，而是“准”

Anthropic 内部有数百个 Skills，但文章强调：

> 最好的 Skill 往往只属于一个清晰类别。

这说明 Skill 不应追求大而全，而应小而精。

一个好 Skill 应该解决一个明确问题：

- 怎么验证注册流程？
- 怎么查某服务日志？
- 怎么发布某个服务？
- 怎么写某类测试？

越聚焦，越容易被 Claude 正确调用。

---

### 3. AI 落地的难点，其实是组织知识整理

很多公司以为接入大模型就能提效。  
但真正难的是：

- 文档没人维护
- 流程散在 Slack 里
- 经验在老员工脑子里
- 工具缺少统一入口
- 坑点没人系统记录

Skill 迫使团队把隐性知识显性化。  
这本身就是一次组织工程改造。

---

### 4. 验证能力比生成能力更关键

文章特别强调 Product verification。  
这点非常重要。

AI 写代码越来越容易，但判断代码是否真的正确，仍然困难。

未来优秀 AI 工程体系的重点会从：

> “让 AI 写更多代码”

转向：

> “让 AI 更可靠地验证、回滚、审查和自我纠错”。

---

### 5. Skill 市场可能成为企业 AI 的基础设施

如果每个团队都能沉淀自己的 Skills，企业内部会逐渐形成一个“能力市场”。

里面不是 App，而是：

- 查数据能力
- 发版能力
- 排障能力
- 审查能力
- 写报告能力
- 运维能力

这可能成为企业 AI Agent 真正规模化的关键形态。

---

## 八、一句话总结

> Skill 是把团队经验、工具、流程和安全规则封装成 AI 可调用能力的方式；它让 Claude 从“会写代码的模型”，变成“懂组织工作方式的助手”。

## 主旨概括

Anthropic 在内部大规模使用 Claude Code 的 **Skills（技能）**，已有数百个技能在活跃使用。文章总结了他们在构建、组织、分发和衡量技能过程中的经验：好的技能不是简单的 Markdown，而是能帮助 Claude 更准确、高效完成具体任务的一整套工具包。

---

## 1. 什么是 Skills：不只是 Markdown 文件

**Skills 是 Claude Code 的重要扩展方式**，本质上是一个文件夹，里面可以包含：

- 指令文档
- 脚本
- 资源文件
- 示例代码
- 数据文件
- 配置项
- 动态 hooks

一个常见误解是：Skills 只是 Markdown 文件。  
实际上，好的 Skill 往往会充分利用文件夹结构、脚本、资源和配置，让 Claude 能按需发现、读取和调用相关内容。

---

## 2. Anthropic 内部总结出的 9 类 Skills

Anthropic 梳理了内部数百个 Skills，发现它们大致可以分为 **9 类**。优秀的 Skill 通常只清晰服务于其中一类；如果一个 Skill 同时承担太多职责，反而容易让模型困惑。

### 2.1 库和 API 参考类

这类 Skill 用来告诉 Claude 如何正确使用某个库、CLI 或 SDK，尤其适合内部工具或 Claude 容易用错的公共库。

**常见内容包括：**

- API 使用方法
- 示例代码片段
- 常见坑点
- 内部 CLI 的命令说明

**案例：**

- `billing-lib`：内部计费库的边界情况和易错点
- `internal-platform-cli`：内部 CLI 每个子命令的用法示例
- `sandbox-proxy`：开发环境出口网关配置、连接失败排查、白名单添加方式

---

### 2.2 产品验证类

这类 Skill 用来帮助 Claude 验证代码是否真的可用，通常会结合 Playwright、tmux 等工具。

文章指出，**验证类 Skills 对 Claude 输出质量的提升最明显**。  
甚至值得让一名工程师花一周时间专门打磨验证 Skill。

**常见做法：**

- 让 Claude 录制测试过程视频
- 在每一步加入程序化断言
- 用脚本自动检查页面或状态是否正确

**案例：**

- `signup-flow-driver`：自动跑完注册、邮件验证、用户引导流程
- `checkout-verifier`：用 Stripe 测试卡验证支付流程和发票状态
- `tmux-cli-driver`：测试需要 TTY 的交互式 CLI 工具

---

### 2.3 数据获取和分析类

这类 Skill 连接公司内部的数据、监控和分析系统，帮助 Claude 找到正确数据并执行分析。

**可能包含：**

- 数据查询库
- 认证凭据
- Dashboard ID
- 常用分析流程
- 字段含义说明

**案例：**

- `funnel-query`：分析“注册 → 激活 → 付费”漏斗时该关联哪些事件
- `cohort-compare`：比较两个用户群体的留存率或转化率，并标记统计显著差异
- `grafana`：记录数据源 UID、集群名称和问题到仪表盘的映射
- `datadog`：说明 `@request_id` 和 `trace_id` 等字段差异

---

### 2.4 业务流程和团队自动化类

这类 Skill 把重复的团队工作流自动化成一个命令。

**适合场景：**

- 自动生成站会内容
- 创建工单
- 汇总周报
- 结合 GitHub、Slack、工单系统等工具

为了让 Claude 保持一致性，文章建议这类 Skill 可以保存历史结果到日志文件中。

**案例：**

- `standup-post`：聚合工单、GitHub 活动、Slack 信息，生成站会内容
- `create-<ticket-system>-ticket`：按规范创建工单，并提醒评审人
- `weekly-recap`：根据合并 PR、关闭工单和部署记录生成周报

---

### 2.5 代码脚手架和模板类

这类 Skill 用于在代码库中生成符合团队规范的模板代码。

它特别适合那些不能完全靠固定代码模板表达、还需要自然语言规则补充的场景。

**案例：**

- `new-<framework>-workflow`：生成新的服务、工作流或处理器模板
- `new-migration`：生成数据库迁移文件，并附带常见注意事项
- `create-app`：创建内置认证、日志和部署配置的新内部应用

---

### 2.6 代码质量和 Review 类

这类 Skill 用于帮助组织内部统一代码质量、自动审查代码。

**可以包含：**

- 确定性脚本
- 代码风格检查工具
- 测试规范
- 自动化 Review 流程

这些 Skill 也可以通过 hooks 或 GitHub Action 自动运行。

**案例：**

- `adversarial-review`：启动一个“挑刺”子代理审查代码，并反复修复直到问题只剩小建议
- `code-style`：强制执行 Claude 默认不容易遵守的代码风格
- `testing-practices`：指导如何写测试、测试哪些内容

---

### 2.7 CI/CD 和部署类

这类 Skill 帮助 Claude 在代码库中获取、推送、部署代码，并处理 CI/CD 流程。

**案例：**

- `babysit-pr`：监控 PR、重试不稳定 CI、解决合并冲突、开启自动合并
- `deploy-<service>`：构建、冒烟测试、逐步放量、比较错误率、异常时自动回滚
- `cherry-pick-prod`：创建隔离工作区，执行 cherry-pick，解决冲突并生成 PR

---

### 2.8 Runbook 故障处理类

这类 Skill 从一个症状出发，例如 Slack 讨论、告警或错误签名，引导 Claude 使用多个工具排查问题，并生成结构化报告。

**案例：**

- `<service>-debugging`：把故障症状映射到工具和查询模式
- `oncall-runner`：获取告警，检查常见问题，并生成调查记录
- `log-correlator`：根据请求 ID，从多个系统中拉取相关日志

---

### 2.9 基础设施运维类

这类 Skill 用于执行日常维护和运维操作。有些操作可能有破坏性，因此需要额外保护措施。

**适合场景：**

- 清理孤立资源
- 管理依赖审批
- 成本异常排查
- 执行关键运维流程

**案例：**

- `<resource>-orphans`：查找孤立 pod 或 volume，发 Slack 通知，等待确认后清理
- `dependency-management`：执行组织内部依赖审批流程
- `cost-investigation`：排查存储或网络出口费用突然上涨的原因

---

## 3. 编写 Skills 的最佳实践

---

### 3.1 不要写显而易见的内容

Claude 本身已经会写代码，也能读代码库。  
Skill 不应该重复 Claude 默认会做的事情，而应该提供它不知道、容易错、或需要组织内部知识的内容。

**好 Skill 应该关注：**

- 内部约定
- 特殊边界条件
- Claude 常犯的错
- 业务上下文
- 非显而易见的经验

文章举例提到，Anthropic 的前端设计 Skill 并不是简单说“如何设计页面”，而是通过和客户迭代，总结出如何提升 Claude 的设计品味，例如避免一些老套模式，如 Inter 字体和紫色渐变。

---

### 3.2 一定要有 Gotchas「常见坑」部分

文章强调，**Gotchas 通常是 Skill 中信号价值最高的部分**。

这些内容应该来自 Claude 实际使用过程中的失败案例，并持续更新。

**示例：**

- `subscriptions` 表是追加写入的，应该取 `version` 最高的行，而不是 `created_at` 最新的行
- 在 API gateway 中字段叫 `@request_id`，在 billing service 中叫 `trace_id`，其实是同一个值
- Staging 环境即使 Stripe webhook 没有真正处理，也可能返回 200，所以要查 `payment_events` 表确认真实状态

---

### 3.3 利用文件系统做“渐进式披露”

Skill 是一个文件夹，不是一个单文件说明书。  
应该把不同场景的信息拆到不同文件中，让 Claude 在需要时再读取。

**做法包括：**

- 在 `SKILL.md` 中说明有哪些辅助文件
- 把 API 细节放到 `references/api.md`
- 把输出模板放到 `assets/`
- 把脚本、示例、参考资料分目录组织

例如，当任务卡住时，`SKILL.md` 可以提示 Claude 去读 `stuck-jobs.md`。

这样可以减少一次性上下文负担，同时让 Claude 按需获取信息。

---

### 3.4 不要过度限制 Claude

Claude 通常会认真遵守 Skill 的指令。  
因此，如果 Skill 写得太死，可能会限制它根据实际情况灵活处理。

**原则是：**

- 给 Claude 足够的信息
- 不要规定过细的固定流程
- 留出根据任务变化调整的空间

---

### 3.5 认真设计初始化配置

有些 Skill 需要用户提供上下文，例如 Slack 频道、团队名称、默认仓库等。

文章建议把这些配置保存在 Skill 目录里的 `config.json` 中。  
如果配置缺失，Claude 可以主动询问用户。

例如，一个自动发布站会到 Slack 的 Skill，如果没有设置频道，就应该提示用户选择频道。

如果需要结构化、多选式提问，可以让 Claude 使用 `AskUserQuestion` 工具。

---

### 3.6 Skill 描述要写给模型看，不是写给人看

Claude Code 启动时，会读取所有 Skill 的描述，用来判断“当前请求是否需要调用这个 Skill”。

因此，description 字段不是普通摘要，而应该说明：

- 什么情况下触发这个 Skill
- 用户可能会怎么表达需求
- 关键触发词是什么

例如 `babysit-pr` 的描述中最好包含 “babysit” 这样的触发词，帮助 Claude 更容易匹配。

---

### 3.7 让 Skill 拥有“记忆”

Skill 可以通过写入文件来保存历史信息，例如：

- 追加文本日志
- JSON 文件
- SQLite 数据库

文章举例，`standup-post` 可以维护一个 `standups.log`，保存每次生成的站会内容。  
下次运行时，Claude 读取历史记录，就能判断和昨天相比发生了什么变化。

Claude Code 还提供 `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` 环境变量，用于获取稳定的数据存储目录。

---

### 3.8 提供脚本和代码，让 Claude 组合使用

给 Claude 现成的脚本和库，是提升 Skill 能力的关键方式。

这样 Claude 不用每次重新写样板代码，而可以把精力放在：

- 判断下一步做什么
- 组合已有工具
- 分析结果
- 生成更复杂的工作流

例如，在数据分析 Skill 中，可以提供一组函数用于从事件系统拉取数据。  
当用户问“周二发生了什么？”时，Claude 可以现场生成脚本，把这些函数组合起来完成复杂分析。

---

### 3.9 使用按需启用的 Hooks

Skills 可以包含只在该 Skill 被调用时启用的 hooks，并且只在当前会话期间有效。

这适合一些平时不想开启、但特定场景非常有用的强约束。

**案例：**

- `/careful`：在操作生产环境时，阻止 `rm -rf`、`DROP TABLE`、force-push、`kubectl delete` 等危险操作
- `/freeze`：限制只能编辑特定目录，避免调试时误改无关代码

---

## 4. 如何分发 Skills

Skills 最大的价值之一是可以在团队中共享。

文章提到两种主要分发方式：

1. **把 Skills 提交到代码仓库中**  
   路径通常是 `./.claude/skills`

2. **制作成插件，通过 Claude Code Plugin marketplace 安装**

对于小团队、少量仓库，把 Skills 放进仓库比较简单。  
但每个被提交的 Skill 都会增加模型上下文负担。随着规模扩大，内部插件市场更合适，因为团队成员可以按需安装，并支持初始化配置流程。

---

## 5. 如何管理 Skill 市场

Anthropic 没有一个中心团队统一审批哪些 Skill 进入市场，而是采用更自然的方式筛选。

**流程大致是：**

1. 某人做了一个 Skill，先上传到 GitHub 的 sandbox 文件夹
2. 在 Slack 或其他渠道推荐给别人试用
3. 如果这个 Skill 获得使用和认可
4. Skill 负责人提交 PR，把它移入正式 marketplace

这种方式让真正有价值的 Skill 通过实际使用自然浮现。

---

## 6. Skills 可以相互组合

虽然当前 marketplace 或 Skills 本身还没有原生依赖管理，但可以在一个 Skill 中直接引用另一个 Skill 的名字。

例如：

- 一个文件上传 Skill 负责上传文件
- 一个 CSV 生成 Skill 先生成 CSV，再调用上传 Skill 上传

只要相关 Skill 已安装，Claude 就可以根据引用调用它们。

---

## 7. 如何衡量 Skills 效果

Anthropic 使用 `PreToolUse` hook 记录公司内部 Skill 的使用情况。

这样可以了解：

- 哪些 Skill 很受欢迎
- 哪些 Skill 没有按预期被触发
- 哪些 Skill 需要优化描述或触发方式

这种数据有助于持续改进 Skill 库。

---

## 8. 总结：从小开始，持续迭代

文章最后强调，Skills 的最佳实践仍在演化中。  
Anthropic 内部很多优秀 Skills，最初也只是几行说明和一个 gotcha，后来随着 Claude 遇到更多边界情况，团队不断补充和优化，才变得越来越有用。

**核心建议是：**

- 先从一个小 Skill 开始
- 把 Claude 常犯的错记录进去
- 用文件夹、脚本、配置和日志增强能力
- 根据真实使用情况持续改进
- 通过团队共享让高价值 Skill 扩散出去
